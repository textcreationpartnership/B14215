            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE RIGHT HONORA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BLE WILLIAM, Earle of PENBROOKE, Lord <hi>Harbert,</hi> Lord <hi>Chamberlaine</hi> of the High and Mighty Prince King CHARLES the first of Great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> his Honorable houshold: one of the <hi>Lords of his Maiesties most honorable privie Councell, Chancellor of the Vniversity of</hi> Oxford, Knight of the most Noble order of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, &amp;c. <hi>George Ienney</hi> Gent: wisheth all true noble honor in this life, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines, and glory, in the life to come.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>OST Noble Lord, I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly intreat you, that you would not count it presumptuous bodlnes, in me a man so meanly qualified, to dedicate a Booke to you, so Noble a personage; the zeale of Gods glorious truth, and the honor I beare to this visible Church of Great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> wherein, I had not onely my first being in an estate of corrupted nature; but in Gods good time, haue by his blessing on his owne ordinance, and my atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance thereunto, given me my better being in a state of
<pb facs="tcp:177007:3"/> grace, wherein I stand: the zeale I say vnto Gods truth, and the honour I beare to this Church, that professeth and preacheth this truth, hath provoked me to this la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. The subiect of this discourse, is the Church visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and invisible; and for as much, as I finde by reading some Bookes of controversies, betweene the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and our Church, the great abuses which the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters offer to our holy Religion, and our Church, that preacheth and professeth the same: and for as much as our Romish English Catholikes, will haue no communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with vs, in our publike assemblies: I thought it fitt in my Christian charitie toward them, being grieved to see them seduced by their hereticall corrupted teachers. To write this Dialogue, as a private conference with them, or so many of them, as this poore Dialogue by Gods providence may come vnto. Right Honorable, I beseech you, not to be discouraged, because I am no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed Schollar, to vouchsafe your Lordships patronage of this meane worke, for after I had finished it, I would not adventure to procure the publishing of it, before I had obteyned the judgement of judicious Divines, touching the worth of it. There was three or foure about <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> that perused it, and subscribed their approbations to the originall coppy, affirming, that it was like to do that good, for which it was intended: which did incourage me to obtaine licence to publish it, and dedicate it vnto your Lordship. I am vnknowne vnto your Honor, yet I haue received favours from you, for I was sometime a servitor in Court, in the time of our Great Master, and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stris, the Heroicall Princes, King <hi>Iames,</hi> and Queene <hi>Ann,</hi> Father and Mother to our deare Soveraign, King <hi>Charles;</hi> whose servant I was, and served as a Gentleman Sewer
<pb facs="tcp:177007:3"/> of her Maiesties chamber in ordinary. At which time, your Honourable favours to mee, with the rest of the Queenes servants aboue the stayres especially, to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence waiters was such, that I cannot be altogether vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindefull, and therefore in this regard, I am especially bound vnto your Lordship, and doe offer this poore worke to you in thankefullnes. But this is not the cheife cause, of my dedicating these my poore endevours vnto you, but because I know you are a lover of Gods truth, which is your greatest honor: your Christian Noble car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage in this church, doth evidētly demonstrate the same. And therefore I presume that this little mite of mine, will be rather furthered then hindered from the Church, that it may remaine in the Treasury of this our Church, for the edification of poore weake and ignorant soules, that are already, or may be in possibilitie, to be seduced for want of knowledge in Gods truth, and the true Church, which teach, preach, and professe the same: Some there be that liue in the bosome of our Church, that are assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly perswaded, that our Church, is a pure part of the visible Catholike Church, and spouse of Christ; this may be a meanes further to confirme them. And some there be that are weake, and infirme, wavering minded, and ready to fall from our Church, and from the saving faith, which is faithfully preached and professed by her. This may be a meanes by Gods blessing, to strengthen them, and many there be, that are alienated from our Church, and that saving faith taught by her, and haue knit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> where they liue in a false faith, grounded on a false foundatiō, this may be a means, to giue them to vnderstand that they are schismatically, and erroniously departed from our Church, and the true
<pb facs="tcp:177007:4"/> faith, preached and professed by her; and a meanes to draw them to repentance, by turning to our Church and the truth therein faithfully taught, which is the spirituall milke, for the nourishmēt of their soules vnto everlasting life, from the false Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> where they are nuz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elled vp in er<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or, superstitiō, and idolatry, to their eternal perdition, if they repent not. I haue shewed them, that the Church, is to be considered two wayes, as it is visible, and as it is invisible: and that as it is invisible, it is truely, properly, and indeede, the Church of Christ. I haue shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, how this invisible Church, is his body, how it is invisible, how it is spirituall, how it is mysticall, and how it is the Catholike Church wee professe to beleeue in the Creede; and I haue shewed them, the happy and blessed estate of this Church, and the severall members thereof: First, in this life. Secondly, in their death. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, at the resurrection. Fourthly, at the day of Iudgement. And lastly, after Iudgement for ever, so farre forth as I can gather by Gods word, &amp; the ministery of our church, and I haue shewed them lastly, how a true converted child of God, may be assured, that he is a member of this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py and blessed body and Church of Christ. The second part of this Booke, consists of the visible Church, where I haue first defined it, in which definition, is conteined the essence of it, in the matter and forme. I haue shewed the infallible markes of a visible true Church, whereby a private man may know it: and I haue shewed the marks that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> holdeth to be infallible, but I haue proved them to be deceitfull, if they be not ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the true doctrine of salvation. I haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the truth of our Church, and that theirs is a false Church by their owne markes, that is to say, Succession,
<pb facs="tcp:177007:4"/> Antiquity, Vnity, Sanctity, Miracles, &amp;c. And therein is inserted divers doctrines of the word and workes of God, worthy of note, which I thought good to shew them, that they might the better conceiue what the Church is, and whereof it doth consist, of which they are greatly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant. And my good Lord, whereas there is not in the world, the least Creature which God hath made, but will adde vnto mans perfection, either for knowledge, or for vse somewhat; so this poore worke of mine, although it doth not adde vnto your Lordships wisedome and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, yet it may ratifie and confirme it in many things, if your Honour will vouchsafe the reading of it: Herein is shewed the true succession of the Church, in all ages of the world from <hi>Adam,</hi> till this very day, and that our Church of Great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> doth succeede the ancient Churches; both in the time of nature before the writing of the Law, and vnder the Law, as the Church of the Iewes; and the Church of CHRIST since the publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Gospell: and that it doth succeede them all, in that which is essentiall to the Church, both in the foundation, and also in the matter and forme: These things I shew more at large, in this ensuing Dialogue fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, which I now present vnto your Lordship, desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring your Honour, to accept the minde of the giver, and peruse it at your leisure. And thus I commend you Right Honourable, to the protection, and grace of God in Christ.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:177007:6"/> you not so much to consider the man that wrote it, as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of it: not so much the Authour of it, as the matter in it: and I make no doubt if the error of your Iudgements, be not seated in your perverse wils, but that you may profit much in your edification by it: But if Satan haue filled your hearts with mallice against our Church, and the truth here preached, and professed, and that your partiall respect vnto the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> be such, that you will walke in the wicked counsell of it, and stand in the sinfull wayes that it teacheth you, and that you are growne to that desperate state, that you will sit in the wicked seat of scorners: for the wicked saith the <hi>Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist,</hi> hateth to be reformed, then there is little hope to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile with you vnto any good; No, if Christ the essence of all wisedome were in the flesh againe amongst you, to instruct you, as he was amongst the Iewes, who were the visible church, and yet condemned and crucified him: but my hope is, that God hath ordained many of you to salvation and eternall life, and in his good time, will effectually call you by opening your hearts, as he did <hi>Lidia,</hi> to receiue the loue of the truth, to your eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall salvation: the zeale of Gods glory in the good of your soules, haue provoked me to this labour: and I hope you will not requite me with hate for my loue, nor evill for my good will; but that you will accept it in loue, as I wrote it in loue, for your edification, vnto happines and salvation for ever. Your Pope and Priests tell you, that they are your Pastors: but where is the good spirituall pasture, by which they doe feede you to eternall life? It is no where to be found, but in the large field of the word of God, revealed in the Scriptures: and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny parts of your Religion cannot be proved thence, nor from thence necessarily concluded: but is drawne out of their owne corrupt inventions, to the poysoning of your soules for ever, if you take not heede, and repent in time. For the prevention of which, I haue shewed you in this my poore Dialogue, which is
<pb facs="tcp:177007:7"/> the purest part of the visible Church, and the safest in this part of the world, for you to ioyne with in Gods service: two wicked props there are, by which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is vphold; the one is the bloody law o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the Inquisition of <hi>Spaine,</hi> by which the people are terrified, from questioning any point of error maintained by that Church: the other is their doctrine of an implict faith, which is in sundry parts of Religion, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue as the Church beleeveth; and by taking from them the Scriptures, that they should not spie out by that pure light, the false doctrine of that Church. Thus by a bloody law, and by ignorance, is that Church vpheld: and if that cruell law were repealed, and that common store-house of Gods spirituall bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings, the Scriptures opened, that all Gods people might resort to it, both in publike, and private to reade it: I am perswaded that quickly the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> would fall without any further strife: but I doe not desire to detaine you long by my Epistle, from reading my ensuing Treatise; and so I rest yours in all Christian duty, if you be Christs.</p>

The greatest Clarkes are never able to sound the depth of the Scriptures in all points, and yet there are such plaine and expresse principles of saving truth threin contained, and that from thence may be easily collected, as may be well conceived by the meanest of Gods children, and therefore the Scriptures are not so hard and darke or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure, as those of your Religion would make them; there is

               <p>Indeed your Church doth hold, if that a man know some points of Religion, as the Doctrine of the God head, of the Trinitie, of Christ his incarnation, and of our Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it is needlesse to know the rest by particular knowledge, but to giue his consent, and to beleeue as the Pastors beleeue.

               <p>And it grieueth me that you should be so hoodwinked and blinded by your teachers; but they deale with you as an vnskilfull and foolish Falkner doth by the Kingly bird the Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con, who tyes to his lewer the wing of a Iackdaw, or a Magete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie, or of a carion Crow, and when he whistleth her off, and being aloft in her pitch, throwes vp his lewer and lewers her downe, and taints her with this carion flesh, and by this meanes maketh her sometimes fall and apt to sease vpon the like, and thus taints her; so that when a more skilfull man flies her and whistles her off, expecting that from her pitch shee might fall at the spring or retriue of the Partridge in the field, or the Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant out of the thicket, or the fowle out of the brooke, he is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, for shee leaues the view of these wholesome fowles, and

Even so it fareth with you, when any of our Pastors, or other skilfull Christians doe reason with you about the heavenly truth of the Word of God, which would nourish you vp vnto eternall life, then doe you sease vpon the carion invention of humane traditions, (and leaue the whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some food of the Word of God) as these, the Church cannot erre, and we must beleeue as the Church beleeveth, by infoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded or implicit faith; and also that Images are lay mens books, and yet the Scripture saith, that <hi>Images and Idoles are teachers of lyes.</hi> And the Prophet <hi>Habakuk</hi> saith, that <hi>the Iust man liues by his owne faith:</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> also saith, <hi>I liue by faith in the Sonne of God.</hi> This shewes that we must liue and be saved by our owne particular faith, and not by the Implicit and vnknowne faith of the Church.</p>

As it is invisible it is properly and indeed the Church of Christ. But giue me leaue, Seniour <hi>Philip,</hi> a little to digresse. You told me even now of the treasure your King and Countrey is inriched with by Gold from <hi>India.</hi> I thanke God our Countrey and King is stored with all manner of necessary temporall treasures, yea, in abundance, for our maintenance, for the Weale publike, and common state thereof, aboue many our neighbour Countries. Besides, God hath inriched our Land with treasure farre sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passing the gold of <hi>India,</hi> yea of <hi>Ophir;</hi> which you if you will play the good Merchant factor whilst you are here, you may inrich your selfe, I meane not with the transitory things of this life, for that is naturall and desired of all men: but I meane the supernaturall treasure of Gods holy truth, the principall jewell whereof is Christ Iesus, whose righteousnesse will so inrich you, that you shall be accepted of God as gloriously per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and pure in his sight. This can no man by nature desire or thirst after, but onely he which is indued with supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall grace from heaven. I tell you, Seniour <hi>Philip,</hi> this treasure is everlasting, and an induring substance, never vanishing; for if I should prodigally bestow on you all that small mite of this treasure, which God in mercy hath inriched me with, I should be never the poorer, but increase my talent greatly: but if you should in a prodigall mind giue me all your <hi>Indian</hi> Gold, you would make your selfe but poore, and a begger.</p>

               <p>The Church, I say, which is properly, truely, and indeed the Spouse and Church of Christ, is, as I haue said, invisible, and also mysticall and spirituall, it is also the blessed, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie, and sanctified, and holy Church of Christ: the severall members whereof haue to their great comfort evident markes set on them by God, whereby it may be knowne, that they are vnited to this mysticall bodie.</p>

                  <hi>I thought you would venture to deale in high points that are too deepe for your vnderstanding, you being ignorant and vnlearned, altogether without Arts, either of Logicke, or Rhetoricke, or other Sciences; you haue no languages, no not so much as the common La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine tongue, and therefore how can you edifie any in these deepe points wanting these helpes.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>George,</speaker>
               <p>I grant that Arts, and languages, and humane learning, are good gifts of God, and good handmaids vnto Divinitie and Theologie: but you dignifie the handmaid, and disgrace the Mistresse. Nay, I know that there be many, not onely of your Religion, but of ours also, that doe so much advance in their affection, secular and humane learning, being the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, that in a manner they thrust the Mistresse Theologie or Divinitie out of the dores of their hearts. Nay, I tell you Seni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our <hi>Philip,</hi> that Arts, learning, and gifts of tongues, be but as the wisedome of the Serpent, if they be advanced aboue, or not ioyned with the Mistresse Divinitie, the innocent Doue to serue her as her servants and inferiours. For Arts and humane learning doth but proue by Arguments of things proposed or in question, whereby reason may be inlightened or informed, which is of things which reason can reach vnto; but Divinitie Preached, doth beget faith, which faith doth apprehend and assent vnto things supernaturall, which reason cannot attaine vnto, and therefore faith resteth it selfe vpon the testimony of the word and spirit of God: as the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> saith, <hi>who hath beleeved our report;</hi> so that faith relieth vpon the report of the Prophets and Apostles.<note place="margin">Ioh. 2.25.26.27.</note> We may see a very good exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple hereof, even in <hi>Thomas,</hi> who would not beleeue the report
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:177007:12"/> of the Disciples of Christs resurrection, except he might haue an argument to proue it to his sence and reason, he would not beleeue; <hi>For,</hi> saith he, <hi>vnlesse I shall see the print of the nailes in his hands, and shall thrust my finger into the prints, I will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue.</hi> And the Disciples being together eight dayes after, <hi>Thomas</hi> being with them, Christ came and said to <hi>Thomas, Bring thy finger hither, and see my hands, and bring in thy hand, and thrust it into my side, and be not faithlesse but faithfull.</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue here how our Saviour doth reproue him, because he would not beleeue the Disciples report, but would haue that which they had spoken prooved by an argument to his sence and reason:<note place="margin">Vers. 29.</note> and therefore Iesus saith vnto him, <hi>Thomas, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause thou hast seene me, thou hast beleeved, blessed are those which haue not seene and yet haue beleeved.</hi> And the Author to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.1.</note>
                  <hi>That faith is the evidence of things vnseene.</hi> And out of mine owne experience, the simple preaching of the faith in the naked, plaine, and simple stile of the Scriptures, vsing also the phrases not refined by Art, but such simply as the Word of God vseth, doth more good in converting sinners vnto God, then those who vse the loftie stile and phrases coy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by Art.</p>

               <p>God forbid I should say so; for <hi>Moses</hi> was learned in all the wisedome of the <hi>Egyptians;</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> was learned, and saith,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 3.6.</note>
                  <hi>that a Bishop may not be a young Scholler:</hi> and he saith to <hi>Titus,</hi>

                  <hi>that an Elder must be able to exhort with wholesome doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, and convince them that say against it.</hi> Which sheweth that learning is necessary in a Minister to maintaine Gods truth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all wicked men and heretickes, who by their learning will oppose the truth: it is good in a learned auditorie; but he is a good Doctor which can teach to the capacitie of the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plest; and to the learned also when occasion serueth.</p>

               <p>First therefore I will shew that it is the body of Christ,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:177007:12"/> then next that it is his invisible body. The first is prooved by <hi>Paul; So we being many are one body in Christ,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 12.5.</note>
                  <hi>and every one one anothers members: for by one spirit are we all baptized into one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, whether we be Iewes or Gentiles, whether we bond or free,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.13.</note>
                  <hi>and haue beene all made to drinke into one spirit.</hi> So that you see by this Text, that this vnion with Christ is by the Baptisme of the spirit, whether we be <hi>Iewes</hi> or <hi>Grecians,</hi> all makes one bodie:<note place="margin">Vers. 27.</note> now ye are the body of Christ, and members for your part. And to adde one place more, the Apostle saith,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.17.</note>
                  <hi>We being many are one bread and one body: for we are all partakers of one bread.</hi> I thinke these places doe sufficiently proue it to be the body of Christ: besides other places, as in the <hi>Collossians.</hi> Besides,<note place="margin">Col. 1.24.</note> as a husband and a wife are no more twaine but one flesh, so is Christ and his Church but one spirituall body,<note place="margin">Chap. 2.19. Ephe. 1.23. 2 Cor. 11.2.</note> for Christ is the head and husband thereof; <hi>for I haue prepared you for one husband, to present you as a pure virgin vnto Christ:</hi> and in the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation</hi> it is said by <hi>Iohn, that he saw the new Ierusalem come downe from God out of heaven,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rev. 21.2.</note>
                  <hi>prepared as a bride trimmed for her husband.</hi> Now what a heavenly thing it is to be of this Church, and of this body. What a blessed Communion haue they that are thus vnited to Christ? This is the right communion of Saints; and this is double, first the fellowship and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the body, and one member with another; next the fellowship and communion with Christ the head. And this is explained by S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> in these words; <hi>That I say which we haue seene and heard declare we vnto you, that yee also may haue fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship with vs, and that our fellowship also may be with the Father, and with his sonne Iesus Christ.</hi> Wicked men doe delight and brag of their good fellowship in wickednesse and vanitie, but such as walke in some measure in a good Conscience in the wayes of God, what fellowship and company haue they? See what the <hi>Author</hi> to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> saith;<note place="margin">Heb. 2.2 3.4</note>

               <p>I answere, the beginning of the new birth is the gracious worke of the spirit of God, and therfore every regenerate man is a spirituall man, such as the beginning is, such must he be which is borne a new: this new beginning, which is spirituall, must needs produce a spirituall estate, and therefore those per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons which by the mercy of God are brought out of the state of corrupted nature, into the state of grace by new birth, are tearmed spirituall men. Furthermore, that the body of Christ as it is invisible and mysticall (as which alreadie I haue proved) so it is also spirituall.

Now in that this woman is said to be clothed with the Sunne, thereby is signified Gods mercifull imputation of Christs his righteousnesse, so clothing her like a wedding garment, that God by meanes thereof seeth no sin in her. For being spiritually clothed with this garment of Christs righteousnesse, shee doth appeare glorious, holy, and righteous in Gods sight.

               <p>Vivification is the second part of this inherent holinesse of the invisible militant Church of Christ, whereby they are in part renued in holinesse and righteousnesse, by which the Image of God is againe repayred in them:<note place="margin">Eph. 4.23.24.</note> for which I proue by <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> in these words; <hi>And be renued in the spirit of your mind: and put on the new man which after God is created vnto righteousnesse and true holinesse.</hi> And the same Apostle saith to the <hi>Galatians; but I liue, yet not I any more,</hi>

               <p>The efficient cause of mortification and vivification, and of our whole sanctification, is the spirit of God, who by his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resistable power convayes himselfe into the regenerate and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving mans heart, &amp; doth in them apply the power of Christ his death and resurrection; and by this createth holinesse, as in the <hi>Rom.

            <sp>
               <speaker>George,</speaker>
               <p>I answere, that it is a cleare case in Divinitie, both in the Old and also in the New Testament, that Christ Iesus is the seede of the Woman that should breake the Serpents head: Which was promised to our first parents <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue;</hi> and it is also cleare, that he is of the seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> vnto whom this promise was renued: and it is manifestly cleare also, that this Christ Iesus is the soveraigne plaster and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine for the cure of all the sores, botches, boyles, and plagues of our sinnes; and also it is cleare that the receipt of this sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne medicine is our cure, and none doe receiue this for the cure of them, but the members of this invisible and spirituall body, or Church of Christ. Now I answere againe to your question, that faith doth it by applying this soveraigne medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine to the wounds and sores of our sinnes. I would haue you to consider what is the nature of faith. In faith there is three things distinctly to be considered, as I take it: the first is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension, whereby a man in his vnderstanding doth know Christ to be a soveraigne medicine for sinne. The next is as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, whereby a man doth acknowledge him to be a true me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, able perfectly to cure his sinne. The third is applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whereby a man doth lay and apply this soveraigne medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine to the sores of his sinnes. And thus doth faith justifie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, and maketh holy in this world evangelically and in part. There be three speciall Theologicall vertues, without the which God doth not saue any; these are faith, hope, and loue; faith apprehendeth and applyeth the promises of grace in Christ; hope expecteth and patiently waiteth for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment of them; loue is so inflamed with them, that it being as the hand of faith, it worketh by way of thankfulnesse all duties of Religion, both of pietie towards God and justice and true charitie towards man. Now all these three vertues are given of God. That faith is his gift, is prooved by these places and many more. First, to the <hi>Philippians; For vnto you it is given for Christ,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Phil. 2.29.</note>
                  <hi>that not onely you should beleeue in him, but also suffer for his sake.</hi> And in the <hi>Hebrewes; Looking vnto Iesus the Author and finisher of your faith.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 12.2.</note> And that faith doth purifie and make
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:177007:16"/> holy, these places make plaine; <hi>By faith he purified their hearts.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 15.9.</note> And againe, <hi>that they may receiue forgiuenesse of sinnes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">And 26.8.</note>
                  <hi>and inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance among them which are sanctified by faith in me.</hi> And thus I haue prooved the holinesse of the Church by the meanes of faith. Now that the Word of God is a meanes also of the Churches holinesse, I proue it thus. First, there is no saving knowledge of God, or of Christ, or of the spirit, and the worke of the Father through the Sonne by the spirit, but it is the Word that revealeth it vnto vs, and that most purely if wee haue the spirit truely to discerne it and conceiue it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Word doth make holy, by declaring the forme and manner of holinesse, which God worketh and requireth to be in all his children. I say it is the outward meanes by which God doth call vs and frame vs vnto holinesse. It is the Lords pruning hooke, whereby he trimmeth and pruneth the trees of mens hearts, to make them bring forth fruits of holinesse; which if it effect not, it is his Axe to hew them downe for the fire. <hi>David</hi> saith, <hi>the Word of God is prooved most pure,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal 119.40. Ioh. 17.17. 1 Tim. 4.5.</note> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them whom it winneth vnto God, it maketh holy and pure. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>All creatures are sanctified by the Word,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his children whom he hath newly created in his owne Image are sanctified and made holy by it.<note place="margin">Exod. 19.10.</note>
                  <hi>Moses</hi> was comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to sanctifie the people, when the Lord was to come downe vpon mount <hi>Sinai</hi> in their fight; even so must the Ministers of God, sanctifie and make holy by the Word, those that must appeare before God in the heavenly mount <hi>Sinai.</hi> I might al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge many reasons to prooue that the Word is the outward meanes of the holinesse of the Church, which for brevitie sake I omit. And thus I haue proved the holinesse of this invisible Church both by Iustification and also by sanctification.</p>

               <p>Your question is good, and as well as I can I will satisfie your demand therein: by the word <hi>Catholike,</hi> as I take it, is meant a generalitie, both of the Articles of faith, and also of the members of the Church. For this word <hi>Catholike</hi> hath relation to both. There is but one faith which is generall, and every
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:177007:17"/> Article particularly severed, is as a part of that whole frame; and so also the Church is but one, and every particular mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber is as a part of the whole. Now, this word <hi>Catholike</hi> doth note out the large extent and vniversalitie of the Church, and also of faith. It is called <hi>Catholike,</hi> for three causes; for, first it is generall in respect of time, because the Church and the faith thereof, haue beene in all times and ages of the world: second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it is generall in respect of the persons of men: for it stands of some of all sorts and degrees of men, high and low, rich and poore, learned and vnlearned: thirdly, it is vniversall in respect of place, because it hath beene gathered from all parts of the earth. All the Articles of faith are of things vnseene; as it is in the <hi>Hebrewes;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 11.1.</note>
                  <hi>Now faith is the ground of things which are hoped for, and the evidence of things which are not seene.</hi> And the Church which we professe to beleeue in the <hi>Creede</hi> is invisible, as I haue proved. And it is called <hi>Catholike,</hi> to distinguish it from particular Churches which are seene with the eye, and not beleeved; as looke to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> where it is said; <hi>The Churches of Asia salute you;</hi>

First in <hi>Abrahams</hi> time, the Church was not included in his Familie; for <hi>Melchisedech</hi> was the Priest of the most high God, who lived in <hi>Abrahams</hi> time. And there were other ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike professors,<note place="margin">Gen. 14.28.</note> whose Priest <hi>Melchisedech</hi> was. Againe, in the time of the <hi>Israelites</hi> bondage in <hi>Egypt, Moses</hi> flying into <hi>Midian,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 2.21.</note> married the Priest of <hi>Midians</hi> daughter, which is probable he would not haue done if the Priest had not beene a catholike professor: I take it to be certaine that he was a catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like professor; For when <hi>Moses</hi> told him all that the Lord had done vnto <hi>Pharaoh,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod 18.8.</note> and to the <hi>Egyptians</hi> for <hi>Israels</hi> sake, and how the Lord had delivered them, therefore <hi>Iethro</hi> said, <hi>Blessed

                  <note place="margin">Vers. 11.</note>
                  <hi>now I know that the Lord is greater then all the gods, for as they delt proudly with them, so are they recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced:</hi> then <hi>Iethro Moses</hi> father in law,<note place="margin">Vers. 12.</note> tooke burnt offerings and sacrifices to offer vnto God, both his thankfull acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in blessing the Lord, and his confession of the greatnesse of the Lord aboue all other gods: and his offering sacrifice to God, doth shew him to be a true catholike. The catholike Church now in the time of the new Testament is especially generall and vniversall.<note place="margin">Rev. 7.9.</note> To which purpose <hi>Iohn</hi> saith in the <hi>Revelation; I beheld and loe a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations and kindreds, people, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lambe, clothed with long white robes, and palmes in their hands.</hi> And our Saviour saith,<note place="margin">Math. 26.13.</note>

Secondly, the members of this Church for the merits of Christ his actiue and passiue obedience in his sufferings and death, haue all their sinnes originall and actuall, with the guilt and punishment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to them, freely pardoned and forgiven them. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. 2. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.8.25. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24. And all the righteousnesse of Christ as freely imputed vnto them, and so God is reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vnto them, and approueth them as holy and righteous in his sight and account. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5.19. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33.34. Thirdly, they are freed from the bondage of Satan, <hi>Act.</hi> 26.18. <hi>Ephe.</hi> 2.2. and are made brethren of Christ and fellow heires of his heavenly kingdome, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20.17. and spirituall Kings and Priestes, <hi>Reue.</hi> 1.6. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. to offer vp spirituall sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices vnto God by Iesus Christ. Fourthly, God spareth them as a man spareth his owne sonne that serveth him. <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.17. This sparing them, is first in not taking notice of every fault, but bearing with them and their infirmities. No father that loveth his childe, will turne him out of his doores when he is sicke. Againe, secondly, he doth not make their corrections and chastisements as great as their deserts. Thirdly, God doth not afflict them as a severe judge, but moderately chastise them as a loving Father, when he seeth that they will not by any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meanes be reclaimed. Fourthly, God graciously accepteth their endeuours, notwithstanding the imperfection of their workes and obedience, and so preferring the true willingnesse of their mindes, before the worthinesse of their workes. Fift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he turneth the curses of the Law, which they deserue, to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly chastisements, crosses, and corrections, yea all things and all calamities of this life, death it selfe, yea their very sinnes vnto their good.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, he giues them the holy Spirit, which first sanctifieth them by degrees throughout, so that they doe more and more die to sinne and liue to righteousnesse. Secondly, assures them of their adoption, &amp; that they are by grace the children of God.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:177007:18"/> Thirdly, encourageth them to come with boldnesse and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence into the presence of Gods throne. Fourthly, moueth them without feare to say vnto him, <hi>Abba Father.</hi> Fiftly, poureth into their hearts the gift of true invocation and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Sixtly, the spirit perswadeth them that both they and their prayers are accepted and heard of God, for the mediation of Christ. Seaventhly, the spirit fils them, first with peace of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science: secondly, with joy in the holy Ghost: in comparison whereof, all earthly joyes seeme vile and vaine vnto them. Sixtly, the members of Christs spirituall body, haue the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of their soveraigntie over the creatures, which was lost by <hi>Adams</hi> fall, and they haue a free libertie of the vse of all things which God hath not restrained, so that they may vse them with a good conscience; for to all things both in heaven and earth, they haue a sure title in this life, and they shall haue the full and peaceable possession of them in the life to come. It is cleare from hence, that all wicked reprobates are but vsurpers, and no better then theeues &amp; robbers of all that they possesse, and haue nothing that they may lay lawfull claime to, nor no place of their owne but hell. Seaventhly, they haue assurance of Gods provident care and fatherly protection over them both day and night. Which care and protection consists in three things. First, in providing for their soules and bodies, concerning this life and that which is to come, so that they shall be sure ever either to haue enough or patience to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with that they haue. Secondly, his holy Angels as Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters he giveth charge to attend vpon them alwayes for their good: yea in danger to pitch their tents about them for their safetie where ever they be: yea Gods care and protection shall defend them as a cloud by day, and as a pillar of fire by night: and his providence shall hedge them from the power of the Deuill. Thirdly, in that the eyes of the Lord are vpon them, and his eares continually open to heare their cry &amp; complaint, and in his good time to deliver them out of all their troubles.</p>

               <p>Alas none is able to conceiue or speake to any purpose of it, much lesse to describe it: it is such an eternall weight of glory and blisse, that all the afflictions of this present life are not worthy of it. Yet if I shall relate some small scantling there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as I haue learned by the Word of God and Ministery of the Church, I hope I shall not be counted presumptuously bold, in regard that I am vnlearned: but my conscience beares me witnesse, my ends are good, which are these; principally the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:177007:23"/> glory of God; next the edification of the private members of the mysticall body of Christ. It pleased God in the beginning of time to create the heaven and the earth,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.20. Gen. 1.</note> and in them innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable creatures; by which creation his eternall power and Godhead are seene; his workes being considered, and these creatures were all good, now these good creatures, from the least to the greatest, according to the agensie of their created natures, doe in some sort resemble their first efficient God himselfe, and looke wherein they doe resemble him, it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth God to ascribe vnto himselfe, by giving vnto himselfe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes accordingly: and why or what may be the reason, but onely to make himselfe better apprehended by vs and knowne vnto vs: he is aboue our conceiving, and therefore for the helpe of our simplicitie and weakenesse, he hath given vnto himselfe these attributes: God doth attribute vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe goodnesse, and in this attribute, all the creatures doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble him: but we must learne to know, how, and what is the difference betweene the goodnesse that is in God,<note place="margin">Psal. 106.1.</note> and the goodnesse that is in creatures: the attributes of God are, as the learned say, given vnto him both in the <hi>Concret</hi> and also in the <hi>Abstract;</hi> in the <hi>Concret,</hi> the <hi>Psalme</hi> last recited; and in the <hi>Abstract,</hi> when he is said to be goodnesse it selfe, and so the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone good, as our Saviour speaketh. In the first, God is good, in the second Text, God is the chiefest good, the onely good, yea goodnesse it selfe. In creatures there are degrees of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, as some good, some better, some better then they, some best of all, and no creatures can goe any further in degrees then to be best of all: but God is aboue all degrees, for he is good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse it selfe; and so it is in all other attributes: for creatures are limited, but God is without all limits, all attributes are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite in God, for they are his very essence. A man may be a man, though not a wise man, and he may be a man, though not a strong man, and a man though not a beautifull man, he may be a man though not a great man: but God cannot be God, except he be wise, for wisedome is his essence; and he cannot be God, except he be strong, beautifull, great, for he is wisedome it selfe, strength it selfe, beautie it selfe, and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:177007:23"/> it selfe. All these and many more of his attributes are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite in him, for they are his infinite essence; take them away, and you take away his very being. <hi>Who will show vs any good,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 4.9.</note> saith the <hi>Psalmist</hi> in the person of the wicked? Good is desired of all men, both godly and vngodly, but what good doth the wicked desire, even temporall, vanishing, and sensitiue good; but the godly desire and seeke after the chiefe good, which is God himselfe, and therefore in the kingdome of blisse they enioy him for euer. God is the very Center of the soule of man. If a man should consider those good things with which the soules of men are delighted here below; is a man deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in wisedome, and by his labour and the blessing of GOD thereupon, hath attained a good measure of wisedome and knowledge: yet what saith the Apostle, <hi>let him that thinkes he knowes, and hath knowledge: know, that he knowes nothing yet as he ought to know:</hi> and if a man could attaine the wisedome of the wisest, even <hi>Salomon</hi> himselfe, yet would not the soule be filled till he obtaine the Center and essence of wisedome, God himselfe. Is it riches with which a man is delighted? Why, here in earth the Canker and Moth corrupt, and our bagges waxe old, and the theefe commeth to steale,<note place="margin">Mat. 6.19.20.</note> and therefore no secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie in them, though a man inioy abundance of them, nay the greatest abundance cannot satisfie the soule and mind of man, which will never be contented truely vntill it enioyeth the true treasure and essence of riches, God himselfe in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heaven. This is that riches which the children of God doe hunger and seeke after, and shall enioy everlastingly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Iudgement. Is it prayse and glory that men delight in? Earthly glory oft turneth to shame to them that desire and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly seeke after it: but the children of God earnestly desire, delight, and seeke the glory of God, and God approoueth of them, and crowneth them with a crowne of eternall glory for euer. All men naturally desire life, yea long life, &amp; it is a good blessing; <hi>For</hi> (saith <hi>Salomon) long life is an honour to a man, if it be found in the way of righteousnesse.</hi> And sure in this world God is our life, but he is our life by meanes of his creatures, which are the elements and the elementary creatures composed of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:177007:24"/> their mixture, but after this life he is life to his children im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately; for he not onely hath life, which the creatures ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them haue, but he is life, which none of the creatures are. Which God is to his children by meanes of his elementary creatures, is but temporall, but as he is immediate life vnto them, it is eternall, and that is in heaven after Iudgement. To be short, I say whatsoever the soule of man doth delight in vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth, take away the sinne of the delight, and God is it vnto them in an vnconceiueable and in an vnutterable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, far beyond the delights of ten thousand worlds, if it were possible to inioy them. To proceede, after Iudgement God shall be all in all to his elect, for when all things shall be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued vnto him, that is Christ, then shall the sonne also himselfe be subiect vnto him that did subdue all things vnto him,<note place="margin">1 Cor 15.28.</note> that God may be all in all.

Chap. 12.13 and Chap. 11.17. the manner of this service is to prayse and worship God by God himselfe immediately, for in heaven there is neither Temple, Ceremony, nor Sacrament, for all God himselfe together with the Lambe Christ doth supply, <hi>Revel.</hi> 21.22. <hi>I saw no Temple therein, for the Lord God almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and the Lambe are the Temple of it:</hi> the service shall be day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and perpetuall without intermission: for <hi>Iohn</hi> saith, they are in the presence of the throne of God, and serue him day and night in his Temple: and thus as well as I can, I haue described vnto you the invissible Church of God.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Psal. 12.14.</note> that assurance no doubt is wrought by the spirit of God: take me a man confounded in himselfe, with the perplexities of his conscience for sinne, as was <hi>David, who roared for the griefe of his heart,</hi> and as <hi>Ezechiah, who mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as a Doue</hi> for his sinne:<note place="margin">Psal. 38 8.

               <p>I answere, that this assurance wrought by Gods spirit is done by the vse of the meanes, which is the Preaching of the Word of God, by attentiue hearing Sermons, and the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures read: Meditation of Gods Word, prayer, and the right vse of the Sacraments. These are the ordinary meanes which God vseth to bring men to an estate of salvation, and God doth not ordinarily without these meanes giue salvation to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, for the spirit of God doth affect his owne course and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance in conuerting soules vnto himselfe: and the deuill doth labour to preuent these straight wayes of the Lord by drawing to coldnesse and negligent vse of these meanes.

               <p>I answer, that the euidences of our assurance that arise out of a sanctified spirit, are many, I will draw them to two heads. First, within vs that are Gods children there are euident tokens, secondly, outward manifest fruits: our inward tokens doe ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther respect either our sinnes, or Gods goodnesse and mercy. In the former, we consider either sinnes past, or sinnes present, or sinnes to come: and for sinnes past, Gods child is an vnfai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned mourner, because they are an offence against the Maiestie of God;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 2.11.</note> and this is called <hi>godly sorrow:</hi> and for sinnes present, Gods child is an earnest fighter, for there is a continuall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate <hi>betweene the flesh and the spirit:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 5.17.</note> and touching sinnes to come, Gods childe is a continuall Watcher of his heart <hi>to keepe it with all diligence:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pro. 4.23.</note> and Gods childe striues <hi>to keepe himselfe vnspotted of the world;</hi> and Gods childe doth <hi>flie the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption which is in the world through lust:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iames 1.27. 2 Pet. 1.4.</note> now for those mercies &amp; goodnesse of God which concernes their saluation, O how highly doe they prise them, basely esteeming all things in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of them;<note place="margin">Phil. 3.8.</note>
                  <hi>I count all things dung that I may winne Christ,</hi> saith <hi>Paul:</hi> and the soules of the Saints with <hi>David</hi> long and faint for these mercies of God for their salvation:<note place="margin">Psal. 63.3.</note>
                  <hi>yea their soules thirst for God:</hi> how is it possible but a man must needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude an assurance to himselfe of his blessed estate of grace, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in him such blessed effects of grace. I could alledge other inward tokens which as seales doe assure a Saint of God of his saluation. Doth any loue God, and loue to glorifie God? then know that that loue is an euident token that Gods loue is in him;<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 4.10.</note> for saith Saint <hi>Iohn, Loue commeth of God:</hi> and yet further saith, <hi>herein is that loue, not that we loved God, but that he loued vs first.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Ioh. 4.8.</note> Now Gods loue is eternall, for God is loue, and loue is essentiall in him, and the influence of his loue being shed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad in our hearts,<note place="margin">Ioh. 1.4.8. Rom. 5.5.</note> doth reflect backe againe to loue God and all his holy wayes, and his children for his sake. The like may
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:177007:27"/> be said of knowledge: for our Sauiour saith; <hi>I know my sheepe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 10.14.</note>
                  <hi>and I am knowne of mine.</hi> Where you see that Christ doth take knowledge of his sheepe, first before they doe know him to be their Pastor. <hi>Away from me yee workers of iniquitie,</hi> saith the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost, <hi>I know you not,</hi> that is, I know you not to be my chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; but of the godly he saith, <hi>I know them and they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge mee:</hi> I might alledge other inward signes of Gods fauour for the assurance of blisse and happinesse for euer, but these shall suffice. Now for outward fruits,<note place="margin">Luke. 3.8.</note> they are such as <hi>Iohn Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist</hi> spake of, <hi>fruits worthy amendment of life.</hi> We haue two speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all places which make mention of them, first in <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Galatians, the fruit of the spirit is loue, ioy, peace, long suffering,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 5.22.</note>
                  <hi>gentlenesse, goodnesse, faith, meeknesse, temperance.</hi> The other place is in the second Epistle of <hi>Peter</hi> in these words; <hi>Ioyne vertue with your faith, and with vertue knowledge,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.5.6.10.</note>
                  <hi>and with know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge temperance, and with temperance patience, and with patience godlinesse, and with godlinesse brotherly kindnesse, and with brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kindnesse loue.</hi> If we be diligent in these things to make our calling and election sure, we shall neuer fall. To conclude, Hath God put a louing childlike feare into thy heart? he coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted by promise by the Ministery of the Prophet <hi>Ieremy,</hi> that <hi>he will put his feare into the hearts of his children, that they shall neuer depart from him:</hi> Hath he shed his loue in the heart of any? let him know for his comfort, that <hi>whom he loues he loues to the end.</hi> Hath the father drawne any to Christ to be saued by his mediation? let him cheare vp himselfe in this, that Christ hath promised that whom the Father hath giuen him, he will cast none away; and also that Christ hath prayed for him, that his faith faile not. To conclude, hath any receiued the secret gifts of Gods loue and fauour? let him solace and comfort him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in this, that the gifts and callings of God are without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. And thus I haue shewed and proued vnto you, that the children of God may be, yea, and in Gods good time at their effectuall calling, are vsually in some measure assured of their saluation: and as they doe grow in grace, so their assurance groweth more strong.</p>

               <p>I pray God we may begin our conference in his feare, and continue and end it to his glory and praise: and thus I define the visible Church, it is but one, and is a sencible knowne Company that outwardly make profession, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the true and vncorrupt doctrine, which supernaturally appertaines to the very essence of Christianity, and is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily required in every Christian; now this Church I say, is but one, and yet devided into two parts, the first part before the second part, since the comming of Christ, that part which since the coming of Christ, partly hath, and partly shall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, embrace the Christian Religion, wee terme as by a more proper name, the Church of Christ: these two parts of the Church, both of the Iewes and Gentiles, the holy Ghost hath as it were incorporated them into one body, the words are these: <hi>that he might reconcile both vnto God in one bodie:</hi>

               <p>That wherein they haue communion is the publike exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of such duties as these mentioned in the Apostles actes, which is instruction, breaking of bread, and prayers: but giue me leaue a little more to speake of the ministery of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Church, as also of the invisible; God for the sinne of our first parents might haue glorified himselfe in his iust iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by condemning all mankind, but for the glorifying himselfe in his rich mercies, he decreed to passe by his severi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of iustice, by preordaining some of the corrupt rascall rout of mankind to eternall salvation, and for the effecting of this, he hath ordained the ministery of the visible Church, so that there is none that doe attaine to be members of the blessed
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:177007:29"/> spirituall, and mysticall body of Christ Iesus before spoken of, but by the ministery of the visible Church: he could haue saved his Elect by his immediate power, or by the ministery of Angels; but God in mercy condiscending to our weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, doth offer vnto vs his heavenly favours in earthen vessels, we come not vnto an estate of grace in the mysticall body of Christ, but by faith, we come not to faith, but by the Gospel preached, as <hi>Paul</hi> sayth, <hi>that faith is by hearing:</hi> now <hi>Paul</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, <hi>that Christ, that he might fulfill all things gaue some Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, some Prophets, some Evangelists, and some Pastors,</hi>

                     </gap>.</note> God was able to make them that be his, perfect in a moment: yet will not haue them grow in strength of faith, and manly age ordinarily; but by the bringing vp of the visible Church we see the meane expressed, that vnto Pastors is inioyned the preaching of the heavenly truth: wee see also how all (none excepted) are brought vnto this one rule, that they should with mild spirits, and willing to learne, yeelde themselues to the teachers to that vse. Whereupon followeth that they are worthy to perish with famine and pining hunger, that refuse the spirituall meate of their soules reached to them of God, by the hand of his Church. God doth breath faith into his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, but it is by the Instrument of the Gospell and word of God: it is cleare that none shall haue fellowship with God and Christ that refuse to haue communion with the Church visible: to this end Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> sayth, <hi>that I say,</hi>

                  <hi>which wee haue seene, and heard, declare we vnto you,</hi> to what end did the Apostles declare that which they had heard and seene, the end is, that you may also haue fellowship with vs, and is that all? no: and that our fellowship may be with the Father, and with his sonne Iesus Christ. So that we must first haue fellowship and communion with the Church and Pastors thereof in their ministration, and then we shall haue a blessed communion with the Father and the Sonne.</p>

                  <hi>All this I grant to be true, but that your markes of the Church be somewhat crased, for the Catholike Church doth shew other marks whereby the visible Church may be knowne, which we will hereafter discourse of; but for this time, I pray proceede in your discourse of the visible Church of Christ.</hi>

               <p>The markes I haue declared are infallible and certaine: and what your markes are, we shall see and consider anone; and now I will proceede as you desire. Those I say againe who are marked with this one marke of the outward profession of one Lord, one faith, and one Baptisme, the visible Church doth acknowledge them for her children: those shee taketh for aliants and strangers in whom these things are not found, and therefore <hi>Turkes, Iewes,</hi> and <hi>Infidells,</hi> are not of the Church. Others we may not deny to be of the visible Church as long as these be not wanting in them, if they haue these, they are Christians by externall profession, though they be vild by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation. Of the invisible Church, these vile ones, are not, because that body consists of none but true <hi>Israelites,</hi> true Saints and sonnes of <hi>Abraham,</hi> which are indeed the children of God, and yet of the visible Church; these may be and often are in respect of the maine parts of their outward profession, who in regard of the inward disposition of their mind, yea of externall conuersation, yea euen of some parts of their very profession, are hatefull to God, and to the sounder parts of the visible Church. Our Sauiour therefore compareth the kingdome of heauen to a Net, whereinto all that commeth neither is, nor seemeth good fish;<note place="margin">Math. 13.47.</note> and his Church he compareth to a field, where tares manifestly knowne and seene by all men do grow intermingled with good corne, and so shall it continue till the consummation of the world. It is cleare in Diuinitie that God hath had alwayes a Church visible in the world, euen when the most parts thereof were grieuously infected with heresie.</p>

               <p>I will God-willing, when time serueth, but now I haue other things to relate vnto you of the visible Church. The vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:177007:30"/> Church, as I haue said, is but one, yet besides the two parts before declared, <hi>viz.</hi> the one before, the other since Christs comming; that part since Christs comming, which we call the Church of Christ is also diuided into parts for your better vnderstanding: I will draw a comparison, the Sea you know is but one, yet hath diuers parts by name, as that part vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your Coasts wee call the <hi>Spanish</hi> Sea, and of <hi>England</hi> the <hi>English</hi> Sea, vpon <hi>France</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Sea, and <hi>Ireland</hi> the <hi>Irish</hi> Sea, and so of others; euen so the Church, although I say it is but one, yet hath it diuers parts, as for example, the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Church of <hi>Greece,</hi> the Church of <hi>England,</hi> the church of <hi>Germany,</hi> the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and so of others, and all these make but one Church; as all those parts of the Sea make but one Sea.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>It is the joynt profession and publike Preaching of the doctrine of one Lord, one faith, and one Baptisme; for this one Lord is the onely head of the visible Church, in whom they acknowledge themselues to be vnited, and in him make but one body: and they all professe and Preach faith in him, and all professe to enter into the visible Church by the doore of Baptisme.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>George,</speaker>
               <p>By the Scriptures; For <hi>Paul</hi> writeth to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> one of his Epistles, two other Epistles to the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> one to the Church of <hi>Gallatia,</hi> and another to the Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and so to the <hi>Thessalonians, Philippians,</hi> the <hi>Colossians,</hi> and to the Churches in priuate houses, and in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> the Angell to the seauen Churches of <hi>Asia.</hi> Thus it appeareth, that the visible Church being one is diuided into parts, and so it will be to the end of the world.</p>

               <p>It may be proved, and I will doe my best endevour to proue it by scripture, and any other question wherein you or any of your religion doe stand in doubt of, which remaine as scruples in their consciences, whereby they are detained from vniting to our Church: I take it to be a truth, that a learned man of ours hath sayd, that they must needes run into over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sights, that cannot or doe not rightly distinguish: First be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Church visible, and the Church invisible, and next
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:177007:35"/> betweene the lesse corrupt or the purer, and the more corrupt or the impurer visible Church, the want of these distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons causeth much oversight, whatsoever we reade of the end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les and eternall loue, and saving mercy which God sheweth to his Church, the onely propper subiect thereof, is the mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call body and invisible Church: to this Church the Lord Christ hath thus promised; <hi>I giue vnto them eternall life, and they shall never perish, neither shall any plucke them out of my hand:</hi> and as those everlasting promises of blessednes and happines belong to the invisible and mysticall Church; even so when we reade in scripture on the other side, of any duty that the Church is bound vnto; the Church whom this doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne, is a sencible knowne company, which is the visible Church and the parts thereof: vpon the consideration, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turately as I could of this opinion, that the Church visible cannot erre in doctrine, I did rub vp and search into my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory what I had learned of our Church, which I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare vnto you: I proue not my selfe to be learned, for if I did, I should but arrogate vnto my selfe that which I am not, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I haue not beene brought vp in schooles of learning, but I giue the praise and glory to God the fountaine of all good, <hi>from whom every good and perfect gift doth proceede:</hi> and next to those worthy instruments of his, whereby I haue beene taught: and now I will adresse my selfe a little to speake to my private Christian brethren, who are a little more learned then the rest, be they either of our Nation or others which proues your Religion: that something they may be edified, if this our conference come to their hands, either by your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port or otherwise.</p>

               <p>This I say, that I doe marvaile that any truely learned man either in the word or workes of God, will be a Papist and of your religion, for that many partes of their doctrine, are against the doctrine reveiled to the world, by the word and workes of God: the Church is as you know, called a body, and this I would haue you to learne, that all bodies whatsoeuer consist of two parts, which are the matter and forme: Let vs a little consider, first, the great bodie of the earth, and the first creation thereof, it is sayd in the first of <hi>Gene.</hi> and the first verse, <hi>that in the beginning,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 1.1.</note>
                  <hi>God created the heaven and the earth, and the earth was without forme and voide:</hi> now it is not sayd that the heaven was without forme and void, for God made that perfect in the first moment of time, which it shall be ever after: now the earth was not perfect at the first moment of time, because it was without forme and voide.</p>

               <p>I answere to be without forme, is to want the essentiall constitution of a body, and also to want a reall distinction of a body, the truth is, it was no body really and actually, for all bodies reall, doe bring forth something, and produce something, but the earth which was the first matter of all things, being sometime without forme, did produce &amp; bring forth nothing: therefore really and actually it was no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect body, the very least body that almost we can see, that is a reall and actuall bodie, whether it be a naturall, a vegetatiue, or sensitiue body, even by the naturall induement, as by a law which God hath put in it, will produce some effect, whereby man for knowledge, or for vse may be bettered somewhat.</p>

               <p>I answere that it is not for the feeble braine of man to search into the secret doings of the most High, for that were grosse curiositie: yet I will shew you, what I haue learned of a learned wri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>er of ours, that this first matter being the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon subiect of contrary formes, it must needes be before
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:177007:36"/> them. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.2. it is said <hi>to be without forme,</hi> vntill God put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it the 4 formes of the elements. Now this first matter of all things did fill the lower world, and therefore it is probable that the highest part of this first matter did receiue the forme of fire, the second of ayre, the third the forme of water, and the last the forme of earth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.3. first light, then firmament, vers. 6. afterwards water, vers. 9. and lastly, dry land, the same verse. And thus God by his Word did make the elements out of the first matter.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Philip,</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Can you shew me what difference there is in the formes of the elements?</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>George,</speaker>
               <p>The 4 elements may be divided into 2. parts, the higher, and hotter, but the fire hath the most actiue &amp; working forme, so that it is most hot and light, therefore in the highest roome. The ayre hath warmenesse and is actiue: these two elements make the second and first heaven, and are stiled by the holy Ghost, <hi>Light and the firmament.</hi>

            </sp>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>George,</speaker>
               <p>The second part is the water and earth, which make one round globe in the inferiour world; these were more colder, and therefore lesse actiue; the water God made most cold and moist, and the earth God made cold and dry. And thus I haue shewed you that God made the first matter of all things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out forme, and then that he did put forme into it, and then by the power of his Word made the elements and their formes, by producing them out of the first matter after he had formed it. These things none can know but by Divinitie; for no hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane arts can teach a man that the first matter of all things was made of nothing, and that the first matter of all things had a beeing before these formes were put into it.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>And how were all other creatures made and created?</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>George,</speaker>
               <p>The other creatures are called <hi>Elementaries,</hi> because they were made of the foure elements. If you aske how they were made, I answere, that God made them by a mixture of the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which alters their extremities and bringeth them into a temper, which you may thus conceiue: First water, being of a running nature is stayd by the drinesse of the earth, secondly,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:177007:37"/> the earth being dry in the highest degree, would dry vp and destroy the moysture of the water, if the ayre should not put into succour his next neighbour. Thirdly, the coldnesse of the water and earth would wholy extinguish the heate of the ayre, if the fire should not succour him. All these thus meeting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, doe sleken one anothers forces, by meanes whereof the elementary creatures spring out. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. <hi>let the earth bring forth.</hi> This had beene vnpossible without heate and moysture, and therefore the other elements joyned with the earth in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction. This I say not to binde Gods power to meanes, for God could haue made the first matter to bring forth creatures when it was without forme, as well as when he made it at the first of nothing,</p>

               <speaker>Philip,</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>And what doth all this concerne the visible Church, which is the thing our Conference principally intendeth?</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>George,</speaker>
               <p>This is the drift of that I haue spoken, to bring you the better to know what the Church is, and whereof it doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist; for as I haue said and proued, that all naturall bodies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in the matter and forme: so I say, all Societies and Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of men either in the Church or Common-wealth, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist also of matter and forme. If a new Corporation in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar be erected in the Common-wealth by the consent of the King, those that seeke to be incorporated in that Societie, doe propose some lawes and rules to bind them in that association, which being agreed vpon, and their Charter granted, then are they a complete bodie. Now what is the matter, and what is the forme of this body? The matter is the men that be mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of this Corporation, and the forme is the lawes and rules in which they are bound in obedience to that Societie; now the lawes is the life and being of any Societie, which lawes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wholy abrogated, the Societie is dissolved: but if any part of the lawes be changed by being in part repealed or augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by further ediction, then the Societie doth not dissolue till they all wholy be abrogated; even as when any naturall agent doth by corruption begin to loose the forme, it remaines still a body naturall till the forme be wholy evtinguished by corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and then it remaines no more a body but returnes to the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:177007:37"/> first principles whereof it was composed.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Philip,</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Well, what is the matter and forme of the Church visible on earth?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>George,</speaker>
               <p>I answer, that the matter of the Church is the soules and bodies of men, which are reasonable and voluntary agents; for no creatures can be of this body and societie, but such as haue reason and will: and the forme of it is the lawes and doctrine of salvation reveiled in the Word of God: but this is the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the lawes of the Church, and the lawes of civill Societies, that the lawes of the Church, I meane those divine lawes in which they are principally bound in this societie are perfect, and will admit no change, either by vtter abrogation, or by part repealing, or augmentation, or by further edition: but the lawes of men doe admit change, because whatsoever proceedeth from them is imperfect: and I say also lawes eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall which are made for seemely order for the administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of those divine lawes, may admit change, because they are made by imperfect men: but for divine lawes, they are imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately reveiled from God, who hath intrusted the Church with them, not to augment them with further addition, or in part to repeale them (as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> like an vnfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full steward doth by her wicked traditions) but to spread them, Preach them, and explicate them, for the gathering the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full together vnder the protection of Christ, the onely foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of their salvation: these lawes are essentiall to the visible Church, and the very forme and life of the Church; if they be taken away, the Church looseth the very life of it, &amp; the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers thereof returne to their first principles, which is either <hi>Turkes,</hi> or <hi>Iewes,</hi> or <hi>Heathens,</hi> or <hi>Infidells,</hi> and therefore I mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> should deny the outward profession of these lawes to be a marke of the visible Church. If a man see a horse in the high way that hath life in him, they will say, he is a horse, but if he haue no life in him, they will say, he was a horse, they will not say, he is a horse: Can they discerne the life of a beast, and are they so ignorantly sottish that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not discerne the life of a visible Church, when it hath life in it: these lawes of God are the Word of life, and worke some
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:177007:38"/> kind of life in the generall multitude by a temporary faith, by which they joyne in communion in the outward worship of the true service of God, but not to serue him in spirit &amp; truth: but this Word and law of God is a word of eternall life to them that worship God in spirit and in truth; for the holy Ghost saith; <hi>Many are called, but few are chosen.</hi> And our Saviour saith; <hi>Feare not little flocke, it is your Fathers pleasure to giue you a kingdome.</hi> And the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> saith; that <hi>if the children of Israell were in number as the sand of the Sea, yet shall but a remnant be saved.</hi> To these chosen ones, this little flocke, to this poore remnant, the Word is a savour of life vnto life. These are they that worship <hi>God in spirit and in truth,</hi> and in these is there a true saving faith wrought. And this I say againe, that this must needs be the infallible marke by which the visible Church is, and may be knowne. What if there be succession of men to teach; what if there be antiquitie in succession, and the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of ordination; what if there be vnitie, and vniversalitie, all these be but accessaries, one thing is necessary, namely, the heavenly word and doctrine: all these accessaries when they are proposed to be markes of a visible Church, they may blind the eyes of ignorance, but men of wisedome will search the life of the Church, whether that be in it or no, and if that be not wanting, then they will admit of those markes which your Church saith are markes, but if the Word, Sacraments, and doctrine, which be infallible markes be wanting, then are your markes snares to catch fooles, or flaps to scare flies. If a man lay in his bed dead, though he had accessaries to his life, about him, as a good fire to warme him, good apparell to cloth him, good meate to feed him, a good house to harbour him, yet all these would not shew him to be a living man, nor would I beleeue him so to be, though all the world should tell me that he is, if I see not his life in him; no more can I beleeue a Church to be a Church, but by the life of doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine.</p>

               <p>I say God created man a reasonable creature, and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary agent, consisting of a body and a soule, which soule is immortall; now God by his word commanded the earth and waters to bring forth other creatures, but when he made man; he sayd, let vs, as if he should haue sayd, man is a more honourable creature, then all the creatures we haue made in all the world, and therefore let vs; the Father, the Word, and the Spirit, be advised as by counsell, of his creation, man is as it were a little world: for whatsoever is in other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in the world, is in man, be it in naturall agents, or ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getatiue, or sensitiue, nay of intelectuall spirits, as Angels, for so is man in respect of his soule.</p>

               <p>I answere, his soule was indued with most rare and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent faculties, whereof some worke in and vpon the body by elementary spirits; and others immediately by their owne for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Marke the Text, and you shall perceiue this to be true, God said to them <hi>bring forth fruit and multiple, and fill the earth,</hi> this is to be vnderstood of the inferiour faculties: <hi>subdue the earth, and rule over the fish of the Sea, and over the fowle of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and over every beast that moveth vpon the earth,</hi> this is to be
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:177007:40"/> vnderstood of the superiour faculties of the soule, which are the more excellent: the inferiour faculties may be subdued by ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary force, which if they could not, then the body should never die no more then the soule, but we see by daily experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that they may be subdued, because we see men doe daily die; but the superiour faculties doth subdue all creatures, and themselues are not subject to be subdued.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>No, are not reason and will to be subdued? how commeth it to passe, that reason is subdued by reason and force of argument?</hi>

            <sp>

               <p>I say that mans reason and will hath no power to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them, but God alone, and if reason be subdued of reason, it is by arguments drawne from the Word of God, so that it is God by his Word that doth subdue reason: they are no better then brute beasts that bury these two noble faculties of the soule, and suffer themselues to be ruled by their inferiour fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, and those inferiour to be ruled of brutish natures: blind the mind, and turne the will, and then meere sence will rule vs.</p>

               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>George,</speaker>
               <p>I answere, that the soule doth worke in and vpon the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy by meanes of the spirits that are ingendered of the more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall elements, whereof the body was composed; and these spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are as it were the middle betwixt the body and the soule, and therefore conjoyne them together. Hence it appeareth that man might die by the extinction of those spirits, and yet Gods blessing and wholesome foode might so cherish and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiue them, that man might haue beene immortall. We see that naturall death is the decay of this bond, &amp; our best health is in the preservation of it. Thus you may perceiue that the elementary spirits are not the life of man, but they are the seate of life, and the instruments of the soule, whereby life is wrought in the body, and if these spirits be decayed by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, then the body dieth, and the soule goeth to God that gaue it.</p>

               <p>I answere, it doth consist in a most free vse of all things for the glory of God, his owne necessitie, and lawfull delight; and that, without all let or hinderance of any of his actions; and therefore if he offended in the intemperate vse of any of the creatures, it was his owne fault; God said to <hi>Adam,</hi>

               <p>To this your question, I answere, that the elements themselues, of which the bodies of men and all other creatures are composed, doe continually rebell against man, for mans rebellion against God by his sinne. As for example;<note place="margin">Psal. 19.5.</note> the <hi>Sunne who like a mightie man reioyceth to run his race, and nothing is hid from the heate thereof,</hi> and God having contracted heate and light into that body, to giue heate and light to the creatures vpon the earth: This Sunne, I say, is by his intemperate heate a continuall vexation to some Inhabitants of the earth, as in <hi>India,</hi> and other Southern Countries is well knowne to our Countreymen traveiling into those parts: Besides we often who liue in these more temperate Climates, by the violent heate thereof, haue the earth so dried that the grasse is burnt vp, and fruits so pined, even as a poore childe at the withered brests of the mother, and also the element of water which is cold in the highest degree, and of a gathering nature, is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall vexation vnto some other parts of the earth by extreame frosts and inundations, as in the more Northern Countries it is well knowne: and also the element of earth, a continuall vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by barrennesse in some part of it, as we see by experience
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:177007:46"/> in our owne Countrey, that some part thereof is by nature more barren then others: We see also by experience, that the element of ayre is in some part of the world so corrupt, that it is also a continuall affliction to the inhabitants: and strangers comming to liue there, out of a more pure and fresh aire, are soone corrupted with agues, rheumes, with fluxes, and many other diseases: now I say againe, that these 4. elements, fire, aire, water, and earth, being the mothers of all elementary creatures, doe nourish all elementary creatures, as mothers doe their children with their milke, and that according to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gensie of their composed natures; as the fire to yeeld vnto them heate and light; the water coldnesse and moysture; the aire warmth and breath; and the earth drinesse and coldnesse. Now it is cleare by experience, that all elementary creatures, haue their dependance for preservatiō, vpon Gods providence, who vseth as subordinate and second causes the elements, who by their influence and operations for the continuance, preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, fertilitie, and augmentation of the elementaries, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their naturall endowments: yet so, that they the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther elements doe not yeeld to the elementary creatures such a perfect influence for their good, as they did at the first creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

               <p>I answer as before, that for mans sinne, the blessing and goodnes of their creation is weakened, and they are all sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to corruption and vanitie, now all the creatures in some sort, haue some resemblance with God in their goodnes, as I shewed before. Now the first degree of goodnes is, that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall perfection, which all things doe seeke, by desiring the continuing of their essence, and beeing, now among the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; some are more constant, and some lesse constant, yet all things covet as much as may be, to be like vnto God in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, even those inconstant natures, though they cannot ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it personally, doe seeke it an otherway, by of-spring and propagation. There is an other degree of goodnes, which each thing coveteth by affecting resemblance with God in the constancie of their operations, according to the agencie of their kinds, the immutabilitie of God they striue vnto, by working alway, or for the most part, after one manner or te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure: now I say, although Gods creatures are innumerable, yet they may all be brought into these 4. kinds, as for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, some be 1. naturall, some 2. vegetatiue, some 3. sensitiue, and some 4. intellectuall or rationall; now all these as I haue sayd, consist in their matter and forme, which forme is the

               <p>I answere that their weakenes of working, commeth by their vanitie and corruption, whereunto they are subiect by reason of Gods curse vpon them for mans sinne, and therefore they doe hold alwayes their equall temper and proportion, with which God did at their first creation indue them, and hence it is that they are often in distemper, either by excesse, or by defect; for excesse and defect are opposite to true pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion.

And the Lord further to expresse his bountie, did giue man libertie to eate of fish, fowle, and flesh, and this further grant was after man had sinned, and after God had destroyed almost the whole world of sinners, saving eight persons. What was there in man to moue him to to this bountie, sure nothing; for the Lord saith,<note place="margin">Gen. 8.21.</note>
                  <hi>the imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of mans heart is evill, even from his youth.</hi> Nay, the Lord, for all man was so sinfull and wretched a creature, did renew his dominion over the workes of his hands, as is expressed in these words;<note place="margin">Gen 9.2.3.</note>
                  <hi>The feare of you and the dread of you shall be vpon every
<pb facs="tcp:177007:48"/> beast of the earth, and vpon every fowle of the heaven, and vpon all that moveth vpon the earth, and vpon all fishes of the Sea, into your hands are they delivered, every thing that moveth and liveth shall be meate for you, as the hearbe haue I given you all things.</hi> Now this dominion and rule of the creatures, which God gaue after the floud of <hi>Noah,</hi> was not so perfect as their dominion which they had, in the time of innocency: for the curse which was laid vpon them at the first for mans sinne, doth still cleaue vnto them, whereby they are subiect to vanitie and corruption; as we may see in the sensitiue creatures by experience, their law of working was not to destroy and devour each other, and to make a pray of each other for their meate and foode, as we see the great beasts, foules, and fishes doe, to satisfie their hunger vpon the smaller; for he appointed them their foode otherway, as appeareth in <hi>Genesis</hi> 1.30. in these words; <hi>Likewise to every beast of the earth, and to every foule of the heaven, and to every thing that moveth vpon the earth, which hath life in it selfe, every greene hearbe shall be for meate, and it was so.</hi> Besides, it is said in <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis</hi> the 6. that <hi>the earth was corrupt before the Lord, for the earth was filled with crueltie;</hi> for beasts and foules do cruelly oppose each other by fighting &amp; tearing each other, as we see by dogs how they doe cruelly teare with their teeth one another, and Cockes with fighting kill one another; as we see it also with other beasts and foules, how cruelly they oppose each other; and all this came by man, who cruelly murthered himselfe by his sinne; and man and woman how cruell they are each to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is too lamentable to speake of.

But is this all? No, they are corrupted in their law of subiection and obedience in their service vnto man; For the ravening beasts, as Lyons, Beares, Tigers, Wolues, and Dogs, with many more, will teare in pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, deuour, and eate the flesh of man; nay, all the host of Gods creatures, are readie prest to execute the Lords justice against man, for his rebellion by sinne against God: a mans horse will

What should I say? it is marvaile that our morsels we eate, doe not suffocate and stop our breath; that our cloths doe not cleaue to our skin, and teare it off our backe; that our houses fall not on our heads, and crush vs in peeces; and the ground we tread on, swallows vs not vp quicke; the very law of the creatures, is so turned against man, for his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecting them to vanitie and corruption, by his sinne against God their Creator, that the Lord is often faine by miracle to stay their rages: as to quench the violence of devouring fire in the Oven, into the which the three servants of God were cast by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar;</hi> and to stop the mouths of Lyons, into whose dennes <hi>Daniel</hi> was cast: our Saviour staid the waues of the Sea, and stilled the tempestuous stormes and winds. Nay, I thinke I may safely say, that the Lord doth continually worke miraculously for vs, in that he stayeth the rage of all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, from working our present destruction, wee having by our sinnes brought them to vanitie and corruption, but this our omnipotent God doth, to glorifie himselfe in his rich good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes &amp; mercy; for as it is in the <hi>Psalme,</hi>

               <p>Thus I begin. All sinne whatsoever proceedeth either from the errour of judgement, or from the peruersnes of will, now I would intreate you, to consider with me a little what I haue formerly said and proved. I haue shewed you, that all bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies both naturall, vegetatiue, sensitiue, rationall, and collectiue bodies, either civill or ecclesiasticall, which is the Church visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that they all consist of matter and forme. I haue shewed you also of man, how he is corrupted in his law of reason, and will, by originall sinne. I haue also shewed you that for mans sinne the whole course of nature, even all the creatures are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted in the law of their working, and subiect vnto vanitie in justice for mans sinne. It now remaineth that I proue vnto you, that the visible Church in her forme and law of working may be corrupted: it is plaine by your owne acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that all men are corrupted with sinne, your owne lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men doe freely grant, that albeit the Pope, as they say, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not teach heresie, nor propound errour; he may notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding himselfe worship Idols; thinke amisse concerning mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of faith; yea, giue himselfe vnto acts diabolicall, even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pope, and yet they hold him head and principall ruler of the visible Church; but this is our comfort, we acknowledge no such rotten and corrupted head, but the head whom we doe acknowledge, is a most holy, most wise, and vncorrupted head, which head is Christ Iesus our Saviour: but seeing the head and members are corrupt, as you acknowledge, and may be subiect vnto errours; hence it is, that the visible Church may
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:177007:49"/> erre, for that which is true in every member of the Church, is also true in the whole: because men in this life are inlightened but in part, and therefore still remaine subject to blindnesse of minde, and ignorance, and to rebellion of their will and affections. I know, that some learned men of ours, doe hold that the whole Church visible doth not erre, but in the parts it may and doth erre, but seeing it may erre in the parts, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not see, but it may doe so, though not fundamentally and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinaciously in the whole: your Church is no more able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend their grosse errours, then I am able to defend my selfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst an hoste of men of ten thousand, and therefore the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill hath taught them a tricke, to defend all in grosse at on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <sp>
               <speaker>George,</speaker>
               <p>The second head of reasons,<note place="margin">The matter of the Scripture.</note> is taken from the matter and contents, as first no other bookes can set out the corruption of mans nature by sinne, the fountaine of this corruption, and the punishment of the same, both in this life and in the life to come; it discovereth sinfull particular thoughts, lusts, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, which no other booke hath ever done besides, the reason of man cannot discerne them by nature, vnlesse it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue a further light by grace. Yea, the Scripture sets downe things, that no mans heart can imagine, and yet are true by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience: for example, that it is an evill thought to thinke there is no God, man by nature cannot imagine it, but it is true by experience, and therefore <hi>David</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Psal. 14.</note>
                  <hi>the foole hath said in his heart, there is no God.</hi> Thus by the light of the Word it is true, therefore the Scriptures is the Word of God. Secondly, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hat the maine contents of the Scriptures are sundry Articles of faith, all which are aboue mans reason, and yet they are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it, but at least some of them may be proved by it; for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:177007:51"/> that there is a Redeemer of the world, is an Article of faith aboue reason, yet not against it, for in naturall vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, God is not all justice, and no mercy, but if there were no Redeemer, then should God be all justice without mercie▪ now because he hath reveiled himselfe, to be as well merciful, as he is just, reason concludeth, there is a Redeemer. Againe, that the Redeemer should be God and man, is aboue reason, yet not against it, for reason teacheth that he must be God, that he might satisfie the infinite justice of God for sinne, which none but God can doe; againe, that he must be man, because that man had sinned, man must be punished for the sinne of man. Thirdly, in the Scriptures there are sundry predictions of Prophecies made before-hand particularly, which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding were not to come to passe till 100. 200. or 300. yeares after: and all these Prophecies or predictions, in the same manner as they haue beene foretold, haue beene fulfilled. As for example, <hi>Iacob</hi> in his Will foretold, that the Scepter should not depart from <hi>Iuda</hi> till <hi>Shilo,</hi> that is, the <hi>Messias</hi> come: this was verefied, even as it was foretold; for a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Christs birth, the Scepter was taken from the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and translated to the <hi>Romane</hi> Empire; and <hi>Herod</hi> put the whole Colledge of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Governors, called the <hi>Sanedrin</hi> to death. I might declare many more predictions, which came to passe as they were foretold, which doe evidently shew, that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are the Word of God. Fourthly, the Law a part of the Scripture, is propounded most purely and perfectly without exception or limitation, whereas in all mans Lawes some sinnes are condemned, but some be tollerated and permitted, but in Gods Law every sinne is condemned, &amp; none either forborn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> or excused, therefore the Scripture is Gods word. Lastly, the stile and speech of the Scripture is plaine and simple, without affectation, and yet full of grace and Maiestie; for in that sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple stile it commandeth the whole man, body, and soule; it threatneth everlasting death, and promiseth everlasting life, and it doth more affect the heart of man, then all the writing in the world whatsoever.<note place="margin">The effects of Scripture.</note> The third reason to shew the Scripture to be the Word of God, is taken from the effects, whereof one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:177007:51"/> two shall suffice. First the doctrine of the scripture in the Law, and especially in the Gospell, is contrary to the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted nature of man; wherevpon <hi>Paul</hi> saith thus;<note place="margin">Rom. 8.7.</note>
                  <hi>the wisedome of the flesh is enmitie against God;</hi> and yet the same Word being Preached, conuerteth nature, and turneth the heart of man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, in such sort, as in this last age, it hath wonne a great part of the world, to the imbracing thereof. Now in reason this is impossible, that a thing which is so flat against mans corrupted nature, should prevaile with it so far, as to cause man to liue and to die in the profession and the maintenance thereof; and this sheweth that God is the Author thereof, from whom the word of Creation came, to which every thing at the first yeelded o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, therefore the Scriptures is the Word of God. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the Word of God hath this effect, to be able to mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster comfort, in all distresses of body and mind, and of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and when the helpes of humane learning, which is of great vse, and force in other cases, haue done all that they can, without effect or successe, even then, the sweete promises of the Gospell, will reviue and raise vp the heart, and giue it full contentment. Experience sheweth this to be a confessed truth in particular cases, &amp; it teacheth whence this word proceedeth, wherein these promises are contained, namely, from God: for when he setteth the conscience vpon the racke, the Word that relieueth and refresheth the same, must needs proceede and come from him alone.<note place="margin">Properti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> The fourth reason is from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of Scripture; the first is antiquitie, which most plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeares in Scriptures by the Histories, though the doctrine is also as ancient; therein is contained a continuall history, from age to age, for 4000. yeares before Christ, even from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the world. The second propertie is, consent with it selfe in all parts, both for matter, scope, and end. The writings of men do dissent from themselues, by reason of ignorance and forgetfulnesse in the Authors; but the Scripture agreeth with it selfe most exactly, and the places that seeme to disagree, may easily be reconciled; which sheweth, that holy men, by whom it was penned, were directed by the wisedome of the spirit of God; therefore the Scripture is the Word of God.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:177007:52"/>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Contraritties.</note>The fift reason is drawen from the contrarieties: the Devill and wicked men, are in judgement and disposition, as contrary to Scriptures, as light to darkenesse. I proue it thus; let a man reade any booke of Philosophie, and labour to be resolved vpon any one point therein, he shall never be tempted to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelitie; but if the same man read the bookes of Scripture, and labour to vnderstand them, he shall haue within himselfe, many motions and temptations, not to beleeue and obey it. Now, what should be the cause thereof, but that these bookes are the Word of God, which the devill labours to oppugne with might and maine, therefore the Scripture is the word of God? Againe, consider the same in the practice of wicked men, they will not brooke the rebuke of their sinnes, as their Idolatrie, blasphemie, and other notorious crimes by Scriptures, but will seeke the life of him that shall sharply reproue them. And hence it was, that wicked Kings so persecuted the Lords Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets. Yea further, let it be marked, that those wicked men that are tainted with those wicked crimes, and cannot abide the Scriptures and teachers thereof to their death, haue common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fearefull ends. Now the opposition of Satan, and wicked men to the Scriptures, shewes them to be the most holy word of God. The sixt reason is taken from sundry testimonies; first, of holy Martyres in the Old and New Testament, who haue given their liues for the maintenance of the Scriptures, and sealed with their bloud, and that most patiently and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, not being dismaid. The stories of Martyrs in all ages confirme this truth; and vnlesse they had beene supported by a divine power, in so good a cause, they could never so many of them, haue suffered in such cruell manner as they did, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Scriptures is the word of God. The second testimony, is the consent of heathen men; heathen men, who haue recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the same things, at least many of the principles that are set downe in the Scripture; if this were not so, man should haue some colourable excuse of his vnbeliefe, and these things which they record, were not all taken out of the Bibles, but were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gstired to memory by Historiographers, that lived in the times, when they were done; such were the stories of the Creation,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:177007:52"/> and Floud, and of the Tower of <hi>Babell,</hi> of the Arke, of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and of his possessions, of Circumcision, of the miracles of <hi>Moses,</hi> of the birth of Christ, of the death of <hi>Herod, Agrippa,</hi> and such like. And these we take for true in humane Stories, much more then, ought we to doe it in the Word of God, which is the Scriptures. The third testimony, is of miracles, the doctrine of Scripture was confirmed by miracles wrought by the Teachers thereof, the Prophets and Apostles, aboue all power and strength of nature, and such as the devill cannot counterfeit; as the staying of the Sunne, and the raising of the dead, &amp;c. The fourth, is the testimony of the holy Ghost, which is the argument of all arguments, to settle and resolue the conscience, and to seale vp the certaintie, that the Scripture is the Word of God.</p>

               <p>I will begin with <hi>Adam,</hi> in whose loynes the visible Church was, even in the time of innocencie, and yet then the Church erred,<note place="margin">Gen. 2.17.</note> the Lord gaue him a Law of prohibition, by forbidding him to eate of the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evill, in which commandement stood his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines, and felicitie, namely, by cleaving vnto God in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to this commandement, but hee erred from this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement,<note place="margin">Gen 3.4.9.</note> in beleeving the Devils doctrine, who sayd, <hi>ye shall not die at all: but God doth know, that when yee shall eate thereof, your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as Gods, knowing good and evill:</hi> This lying doctrine, <hi>Adam</hi> beleeved and obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his owne ruine, and the corrupting his posteritie, this precept was easie for <hi>Adam</hi> to haue kept, seeing hee was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly pure by Creation, and had abilitie to performe his act of obedience. But seing the Church in innocency erred, there is little hope, that the Church visible, consisting of none, but corrupted members, should not erre. See what followed in the succeeding times of the visible Church, it was worse and
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:177007:53"/> worse, as may be seene by the corruption and confusion, that was in the time of <hi>Noah</hi> and of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and amongst the <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> notwithstanding the miracles they saw, every day wrought before their eyes; as saith the Lord by <hi>Ezechiell.

               <p>The next period of the Church, is vnder the Law. God hath had ever some Church visible vpon the earth, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vnder the Law. <hi>When the people of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 32. Psal. 106.19. 2 Kings. 18 4. Iere. 11.13. 2 King 22.17</note>
                  <hi>both Priests and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, worshipped the Calfe in the Wildernesse; When they adored the brasen Serpent; When they served the gods of the Nations; When they bowed their knees to Baall; When they burnt Incense, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered sacrifice to Idols.</hi> Were not these errours, thinke you, and yet were they the visible Church of God that fell away into these vile abuses? True it is, the wrath of God was most fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inflamed against them, and their Prophets, justly condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them, as an adulterous seede, and a wicked generation of miscreants, which had forsaken the living God, and of him were likewise forsaken, in respect of that singular mercy, wherewith he kindly and lovingly embraceth his faithfull children. Howbeit, the members of the visible Church they were, and had formerly bin, that thus after abandoned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to Idolatry, and to the service of strange gods: yea, mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the visible Church, continued many of them still, that yet worshipped the brasen Serpent, and that sacrificed in the high places, though directly contrary they did therein, to Gods expresse word and will. Finally, when the <hi>Iewes</hi> would not hearken, to the admonition of the Prophets of God, the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous God would, as it were, force them by his mercy, and therefore sent them downe from heaven, salvation it selfe, to
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:177007:54"/> wit, Iesus Christ his onely Sonne our Lord. But how did the visible Church carry her selfe towards him? Surely, he had no greater enemies, then the Priests, the Scribes, the Doctors, and the Pharisies; and these were the Cleargie, as you speake, and such as had the Law committed vnto them; these were those which should haue beene the lights of the Church; and these, if Christ spake of the reformation of the Church, they said, <hi>He would destroy the Temple;</hi> if he spake of the grace of God offered by the <hi>Messias,</hi> then they said, <hi>He blasphemed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Law of God;</hi> if he spake of the kingdome of heaven, then he spake <hi>against the Maiestie of Caesar;</hi> if he wrought mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, then they said, <hi>it was by the power of the devils;</hi> and if he alledged the Scriptures, then they demanded to see his orders for his Doctorship; and they cast him in the teeth, that <hi>he was but a Carpenters Sonne.</hi> And if you consider the Church visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble amongst the people, they chose <hi>Barrabas,</hi> a murtherer, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing Christ the <hi>Messias,</hi> and him they Crucified. Oh, what a feareful errour was this of the Rulers, and people of that visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church! And thus much, in briefe, of the errours of the visible Church from time to time, till Christ his ascension in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to heaven. I might haue shewed multitudes of examples in particulars, of the error of the visible Church before the Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying of Christ; but for the avoiding of wearisome tedious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to you and my selfe; I haue thought these sufficient, and if you will but acquaint your selfe with the Scriptures, you shall find much more errour to haue beene in the visible Church, then any man can well relate by speech vnto you.</p>

               <p>I answere, the visible Church, as I haue said, is but one; of which Church, all parts haue not beene alwayes equally sincere and sound. In the dayes of <hi>Abia,</hi> it appeareth plainely, that <hi>Iudah</hi> was by many degrees, more free from heresie and pollution then <hi>Israell;</hi> as that solemn Oration sheweth, where he pleadeth for the one against the other, on this wise; <hi>O Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robeam, and all Israell, heare you mee, haue you not driven away the Priests of the Lord, the sonnes of Aaron, and the Levites, and
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:177007:54"/> haue made you Priestes like the people of the Nations: whosoever commeth to consecrate with a young Bullocke and seaven Rammes, the same may be a Priest of them that are no gods; but we belong vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord our God, and haue not forsaken him, and the Priests the sonnes of Aaron minister vnto the Lord every morning and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry evening burnt offerings and sweet incense, and the bread is set in order vpon the pure Table, and the Candlestickes of gold, with the Lampes thereof to burne every evening; for we keepe the watch of the Lord our God, but yee haue forsaken him.</hi> And doe you not thinke, that the parts of the Christian Church, were defiled more one then another, with error &amp; corruption, after Christs ascension? In S. <hi>Pauls</hi> time, the puritie and integritie of <hi>Rome</hi> was famous: oh, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> were now as then it was! we need not then be exhorted, to joyne with it in Gods service; for we would willingly glorifie God in her commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and fellowship, but as shee is we dare not, least we be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of her sinnes. Reade the Epistles to the Church of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and you shall find her many wayes reprooved. Looke into the Church of <hi>Galatia,</hi> and you shall find by the Epistle which <hi>Paul</hi> writ to them, that they were much more out of square, then <hi>Corinth</hi> was. Looke in S. <hi>Iohn</hi> his time, who (as I take it) out-lived all the Apostles, and you shall find <hi>Ephesus</hi> and <hi>Smyrna</hi> in far better state of puritie, then <hi>Thiatira</hi> and <hi>Pergamus</hi> were: the errors of them I omit for brevities sake.</p>

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:177007:55"/> make it goe vpright in the faith of Gods truth; if one part be full of Leprosie, the pure part should labour to clense it; if one part be sicke vnto death in heresie, the sounder part should labour to keepe it aliue in the Lords truth. This dutie hath our Church of great <hi>Brittaine</hi> charitably performed towardes the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as is evident both by the learned bookes of our late gracious renowned &amp; learned King; as also by the learned and godly disputations, and bookes of Controversies with your Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and yet shee continueth in her corruptions and heresies still.

I would wish you Seniour <hi>Philip,</hi> and all private men to obey the voyce of Christ, and be well acquainted with it, to discerne it from the voyce of Antichrist, which speaketh in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Blessed be God, the voyce of Christ in the Gospell, hath prevailed with many in drawing them to repentance; and although the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> doe labour to suppresse and darken the light of it, yet God in mercie doth still keepe it open, and causeth it to shine, whereby many are gathered into the more pure part of the visible Church, to their eternall salvation.</p>

Thus you may perceiue, that the visible Church at this great day of destruction, shall haue an end; nay, the inke, paper, and parchment of the Word of God must be destroyed with fire, but the Word of God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth for ever.</p>

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:177007:57"/> and before the word of God was written, for God reveiled this foundation to <hi>Adam,</hi> by word of mouth, and renewed the same to the 12. <hi>Patriarkes,</hi> by tradition for the space of 2400 yeares: vnto the time of <hi>Moses,</hi> the liues of men in the <hi>Patriarkes</hi> times, were long, and their memories served as bookes, to record this foundation, and therefore when the liues of men were shortened by sinne, it pleased God to vse in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to his Church, meanes more durable; and therefore in <hi>Moses</hi> time, committed the foundation, and doctrine of the Church to writing: therefore our Saviour Christ sayth now, <hi>Search the Scriptures, for in them, you thinke to haue eternall life, for they testifie of me:</hi> So that if ever we will finde the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the doctrine, to build the Church vpon this founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we must looke into the scriptures for all, or else, we shall never but goe astray; therefore the Apostle sayth,<note place="margin">Ephe. 2.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I answere, that Iesus Christ our Saviour, is also the alone head of the Catholike Church, for he is not onely the strong and powerfull ground and foundation of the Church, to vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it, that it sinke not into the sea of Gods wrath, to its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion for ever, but hee is also the head and husband of the Church, who wisely governes his Spowes the Church, and that he is the head of the Church, see what the Apostle saith to the Ephesians,<note place="margin">Ephe. 1.10.</note>
                  <hi>and hath made all things subiect vnder his feete, and hath given him over all things, to be the head to the Church, which is his body;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Chap. 5.</note> and he sayth further, in the 5. Chap. <hi>For the husband is the wiues head, even as Christ is the head of the Church, and the same is the Saviour of his body,</hi> and to the <hi>Colos.</hi> he saith,<note place="margin">Col. 2.10.19.</note>
                  <hi>and yee are complete in him, which is the head of all prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipallitie and power,</hi> and he is the master of the Church, Christ Iesus our Saviour is the essentiall word and wisedome of the Father,<note place="margin">Math. 10.25.</note> and therefore wisely disposeth the building of the Church, vpon the foundation, which is himselfe: wee know by naturall reason, that though the soule of the body of man, is the life of every part, yet the seate of reason, wisedome, and vnderstanding is in the head, even so the soule of the Church, is the spirit of God, which spirit doth knit vs the members of the Church, vnto our head Christ, yet the seat of the wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the Church, is in the head, which head, is anoynted with oyle of wisedome, and gladnes aboue his fellowes, and of his fulnes, doth the Church receiue grace for grace, and the severall members by him are made wise vnto salvation, this is indeede and in truth, the head of the Catholike Church, and vnder this head, doth our Church of great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse the Catholike faith, and our particular Church of great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> doth acknowledge no other Catholike head of the vniversall Church; wee acknowledge our Soveraigne King CHARLES, to be supreame governour, of all causes Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall and civile, in his dominions, next and immediately vnder Christ; but we doe not acknowledge him to be the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame of the Catholike Church, neither will he be so impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, to take this title vpon him; that title which he doth iust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:177007:58"/> take vpon him, and wee doe ascribe vnto him, is the gracious ordinance of God, for <hi>Esay</hi> prophesied that <hi>Kings should be nursing Fathers, and Queenes should be nursing Mothers,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Isay. 49.</note> even to the Churches of the Gentiles. The first king that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned the Common-wealth, and Church of <hi>Israel,</hi> was <hi>Saul,</hi> his name as sayth the learned, signifieth desired, for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple being weary of the government of God,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 8.7.</note> desired to haue a king to governe them, and God granted them their desire, and gaue them <hi>Saul</hi> to be their king; and after <hi>Saul, David,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Sam. 16.17.</note> and then <hi>Salomon,</hi> and the rest lineally after him, till the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> by Gods iust iudgement, for the sinnes of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Church, did conquer them, and then the scepter was taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from the Tribe of <hi>Iuda,</hi> which was the Kings Tribe, but remained still with the <hi>Sanedrin</hi> of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> but when the prophesie of <hi>Iacob</hi> was fulfilled, which was,<note place="margin">Gen. 49.10.</note> that <hi>Shilo should come,</hi> which <hi>Shilo</hi> was <hi>Christ,</hi> then did the <hi>Romanes</hi> take away the scepter from <hi>Iuda,</hi> and not before: now I say that <hi>Saul</hi> the first king, was not of the Tribe of <hi>Iuda,</hi> because he was desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of the people, but <hi>David</hi> being chosen of God for their king, hee was of the Tribe of <hi>Iuda,</hi> of whose seede lineally Christ came: now you see that kings are the ordinance of God: see what the head and foundation of your Church saith, which is <hi>Peter</hi> the Apostle,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.13.</note>
                  <hi>Submit your selues vnto every ordinance of man for the Lords sake, whether it be vnto the King, as vnto the superiour,</hi> heare what the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> saith, <hi>he calleth the king the superiour,</hi> but your Pope will be supreame aboue him, and he saith further, <hi>and vnto Governours, as vnto them that are sent of him, for the punishment of evill doers, and for the prayse of them that doe well:</hi> and see their power confirmed by the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> in these words,<note place="margin">Rom. 13.1.2.3.4.5.</note>
                  <hi>Let every soule be subiect to the higher pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> these powers are the Magistrates, <hi>and they are ordained of God,</hi> and there must be subiection to them, <hi>for conscience sake:</hi> Let your Pope and Priestes, and People, looke to this ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God, but your Pope especially makes no conscience of this ordinance of God, but shewes himselfe as king of kings: now further what saith our Saviour Christ, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the power of kings, saith he, <hi>giue vnto Caesar, the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:177007:59"/> thing that is Caesars.</hi> Thus you see what we attribute vnto our king, which is a superioritie of governement in his owne do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, and not over the whole Catholike Church: but to the head and foundation of the Church, I say againe vnto you Seniour <hi>Phillip,</hi> and to all priuate men whatsoever, by way of admonition, that you looke most carefully to the head and foundation of your soules: for it is a dangerous matter in this to be deceived; for the building of your soules, must be answerable to the foundation, and that must be by sound, pure, and wholesome doctrine: let me shew you a little resemblance; A man that buildeth an house, and setteth it partly, vpon a firme and strong foundation, and partly, vpon an vnfirme, san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and vnsound foundation, that vnsound foundation, being not strong to beare vp the building, will be an occasion of the fall, and ruine of the whole frame: whereas if the builders had built the house vpon the strong foundation onely, though they had not builded it so cunningly as they should, yet there is hope the house would stand, by reason of the strong foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation; and that part of the vnskilfull building, by better ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise might be mended: now to apply this to our present pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; your Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> doth build, as they pretend your soules to God, and they doe lay a foundation; this foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is partly <hi>Christ,</hi> and partly <hi>Peter,</hi> and his supposed succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors the Popes. Now I say the latter part of their foundation is erroneous and vnsound, and will proue the vtter destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of your soules for ever; for Christ will be the whole foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, or none at all, and therefore build not your soules vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on such deceitfull foundations; as these, that <hi>Peter</hi> had a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty over the rest of the Apostles. 2. That hee was a particular Bishop. 3. That he was Bishop of <hi>Rome.</hi> 4. That he had his seate at <hi>Rome</hi> 25. yeares. 5. That the Pope that now is, is <hi>Peters</hi> successor, and 6.

               <p>You make me remember a thing done in my Fathers house, when I was a little boy: there was a Plow-man of my Fathers, who being a good husband, had by his thrift got a stocke of money, and in a Winter evening received 3. pound of one of his debtors, and told it by the Kitchin fire, before his fellowes: and one of them a wicked fellow, covetous of his money, vpon a sudden went out of the Kitchin, as if he went to bed; but indeede, went and stood behind the stable doore, with his hatchet in his hand, prepared ready against hee that had the money should come to bed, who lay over his horses, and when he came to bed, he strucke his fellow on the head with his hatchet, and dazeled him, and he that was strucken, laid his hand vpon his head, and the theevish fellow strucke againe with his hatchet, and hit his fellow that had the money,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:177007:60"/> on the backe of the hand, the Plow-man being thus vilely strucken, cryed out so, that the whole house-hold came out to helpe him, and the doggs came out running before them, so that the theevish fellow was prevented of his purpose, and was inforced to flee from him, whom hee had thus treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously strucken, and being out of sight of the whole house<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, runneth with the doggs deceitfully, as if he had set them on the theefe: but indeede himselfe was the cheefe, as was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards well proved; even so it is with your Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> all visible parts of the Church, that haue purged and refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med themselues, from the drosse and filth of your corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, you tearme them schismatikes, and hereticall Churches- when in truth, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> her-selfe, is the most no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious hereticall, and schismaticall Church in the world: but why are those parts of the visible Church hereticall? even forsooth, because they will not acknowledge the Popes tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and arrogancie over the Catholike Church, which by their report, is the principall Article, we must beleeue, if we will be saved, and againe, because we reiect Images: and because, wee worship not the bread in the Communion: and because, wee communicate vnder both kindes: and because, the Priestes with vs are married: and because, wee know not what Purgatory is, nor alow of it: these and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more of your heresies, because we alow them not, but ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre them, because they are contrary doctrines to Gods truth, therefore all the reformed Churches, are Churches of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes, and your Pope doth set his Priests, and Iesuites, to barke at the true reformed Churches, as if they were theeues, and robbers, that come in at the window, rather to fleece the flocke of Christ, then to feede them with whole some foode of Gods truth, when indeede they themselues, are the starvers, fleecers, and stroyers of the flockes of Christ Iesus.</p>

               <p>God willing, by this marke, I will proue our Church, to be a pure part of Christs visible Church, which I shall the better proue, if I shew you the successiō of the visible Church, even from the beginning of the world, which I will doe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my poore vnderstanding and reading, and that I hope according to the Analogie of faith reveiled in the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and the ministery of the word of faith in this Church, wherein I haue beene bred all my dayes. I doe hold it a truth, that ever since the world was created and finished, there was a visible or sensible knowne Church: the Church was once in innocencie, in the loynes of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue,</hi> and though <hi>Adam</hi> by eating the forbidden fruit, made himselfe, and his posterity, no Church of God, yet before God did giue sentence against them, hee laid the foundation of the Church in the promise, <hi>that the seede of the woman should breake the Serpents head:</hi> and this promise was made sencible to <hi>Adams</hi> vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, though he and <hi>Eue</hi> had not grace of faith, to build their soules vpon it, till God had given sentence of guiltines, and condemnation vpon them: I say then that Christ the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised seede of the woman, for in him the second person in the
<pb facs="tcp:177007:62"/> Trinitie, assumed our nature, so that those two natures, were yet but one person, is the foundation of the visible Church: but how is he the foundation of the visible Church? Not as he is the foundation of Gods elect; he is the foundation of the visible Church, by externall profession, and externall mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery, whereby they do outwardly acknowledge, and outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proclaime him to bee the head, and foundation of the Church: for even those that haue not saving and sanctifying grace, yet may conceiue and beleeue Christ to be the <hi>Messias,</hi> who should reconcile men vnto God, and they may conceiue and beleeue him to be God, because God, who in nature is infinite, and is infinitely offended, is to be appeased also, by such a nature as is infinite, as also they may conceiue and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that man having offended God, must make satisfaction, which no man nor Angell could doe, but the man Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, being perfect God and perfect man. And this foundation God layd, before he called <hi>Adam,</hi> either externally to be a past<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, or builder of the soules of others vpon this foundation, yea or before hee called him by an effectuall calling, to build his owne soule vpon this foundation by faith; so that God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe immediately did preach Christ vnto <hi>Adam,</hi> and by his preaching, did call <hi>Adam</hi> by an effectuall calling, and gaue him faith to build his soule vpon Christ the foundation: hee made him also a Priest, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>lesse the people, proceeding from his loynes, and to offer sacrifices for himselfe and the people. He was also a King to governe them, and a Prophet to teach them: now that <hi>Adam</hi> was a priest, I thinke wee neede not doubt, for the which I alledge this reason; first, <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue</hi> having sinned, they were both ashamed, and God clothed them with skins of beasts, to shew them their beastlines; now the bodies of those beasts (it may be thought) were for <hi>Adam</hi> to offer in sacrifice, and that by them God caught him a law, and vse of sacrifice: for it is not likely, that God would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy beasts, to haue them spoyled; and it may seeme that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> had not libertie yet to eate any; and we see, that <hi>Caine</hi> and <hi>Abell</hi> offered sacrifices, as being taught by their father <hi>Adam.</hi> These sacrifices were types, and figures of Christ to come, who
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:177007:62"/> should be slaine, and offered as an eternall sacrifice, well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing vnto God for the sinnes of the world: now as God gaue <hi>Adam</hi> a law of sacrifices, so also hee gaue him a law of faith, and obedience, which law of faith and obedience, is the very same law of faith, and religious obedience, which we in the Church of great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> doe professe with them, as you shall heare anone. Now I say, <hi>Adam</hi> was the first builder of the soules of men vpon the foundation, which God in his infinite goodnes, mercie, and power had laid: and he built them by that law and rule, faith and doctrine, which God had taught him, and this faith, doctrine, and law of working, is insepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably ioyned to those builders, whom God doth send; and therefore none must seperate those whom God hath joyned: and therefore I marveile, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doe make succession of Pastors, to be a marke of the Church of God, without succession of doctrine.</p>

<pb n="111" facs="tcp:177007:63"/> therefore there were other Priests as I take it, besides the line of Priests which I haue recited: but those Priests were onely kept in memory by tradition, and registred by <hi>Moses;</hi> because of their line the high Priest of our profession Christ should come, and because in that line, Religion was most purely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served.</p>

               <p>I thinke I can doe it, and that very plainely in the last Chapter of his Booke, the Lord being angry, and his wrath kindled against <hi>Eliphas</hi> the <hi>Temanite,</hi> &amp; his two friends; <hi>for yee haue not spoken of me the thing that is right, like my servant</hi> Iob; <hi>therefore take vnto you now seaven Bullocks, and seaven Rams, and goe to my servant</hi> Iob, <hi>and offer vp for your selues burnt offering, and my servant</hi> Iob <hi>shall pray for you, for I will accept him,</hi> least I should put you to shame; thus you see that <hi>Iob</hi> was a Priest; and did the office of a Priest, to pray for, blesse, and receiue the sacrifice of the people brought to him by Gods command: this confirmes that I haue formerly sayd of the Priesthood of <hi>Adam,</hi> and his successours.</p>

                  </gap>th earth, or earthly; and <hi>Adams</hi> first son was <hi>Cain,</hi> which signifieth <hi>possession,</hi> for so did <hi>Adam</hi> name him: but he perceiving what might be the comfort of such possession, nameth his second <hi>Abell,</hi> which signifieth <hi>vanitie,</hi> to shew, that if a man haue never so large kingdomes, or pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions, or be never so nobly borne, as <hi>Cain</hi> was, except the sonne of God, it is all but vanitie, and a vexation of minde. This is the doctrine that we the Church of great <hi>Brittaine</hi> doe professe and teach, that Christ is the onely gaine and possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that all other gaine and possession is but vanitie and vexation without him; therefore <hi>Adam</hi> nameth his third son <hi>Seth,</hi> which signifieth <hi>setled;</hi> so that <hi>Adam</hi> considered his own miserable condition by sinne, and the vanitie of all things in this world, Gods grace so wrought with him, that by faith he setled himselfe vpon the promised seed, Christ Iesus, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable rock of our salvation: and to expresse his stabilitie of
<pb facs="tcp:177007:64"/> faith, called his sonne <hi>Seth,</hi> that is, <hi>setled.</hi> Now you shall see by the names of the rest of the ten fathers, what vertues are signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by them, <hi>Seth</hi> having obtained by Gods free favour the faith of his father <hi>Adam;</hi> this faith being the principall grace, whereby the soules of the righteous are knit vnto Christ; and it is faith in Christ, that produceth a godly life; for, <hi>what is not of faith is sinne,</hi> therefore <hi>Seth</hi> calleth his sonne <hi>Enosh,</hi> which signifieth <hi>zealous,</hi> and therefore sorrowfull; and this he did, because he saw the corruption of Religion, and good life to insue vpon the marriage of the sonnes of God with the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of men, who regard worldly preferment rather then the promise of life everlasting, by continuing in true Religion, which zeale and sorrow we professe for the like sinnes. <hi>Enosh</hi> named his sonne <hi>Kenan,</hi> which signifieth the contrite or god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repentance, which sorrow is mentioned by the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> where he saith; <hi>I reioyce not that yee did sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, but that yee sorrowed vnto repentance:</hi> which sorrow vnto repentance, is a turning from all sinne vnto God: and this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, sorrow, and repentance we professe and teach. Now as repentance commeth of godly sorrow, and as faith, zeale, and godly sorrow vnto repentance, are gracious gifts of God; so there is required a thankefull acknowledgement of them; therefore <hi>Kenan</hi> named his sonne <hi>Mahalaleel,</hi> which signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>prayse God;</hi> which none can doe effectually, without an humble and a lowly mind; he knowing that such fruit is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of such a tree, therefore he nameth his sonne <hi>Iared,</hi> the humble or lowly. Now looke backe a little, what hath bin said by the first builders of the Church, first, they setled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues vpon Christ the sure foundation of the Church; next, they are zealous for Religion, and sorrowfull for the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the times; next, they are contrite and sorrowfull, and repent, and turne to God from their owne sinnes; and then they are thankfull, and prayse God for all his spirituall favours, and corporall blessings: and all these vertues which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, must be in an humble and a lowly minded man, that is indued with all the foresaid graces. They with vs say, he shall be a vessell sanctified vnto honour, meete for the vses of the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:177007:64"/> Lord: therefore <hi>Iared</hi> the <hi>lowly,</hi> named his sonne <hi>Henoch</hi> the <hi>holy,</hi> which is the signification of his name, and therefore it is sayd, he walked with God: and this he did in a holy conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation of life, as a man dedicated to God, and therefore was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vp into heaven. Thus we see by the signification of these names, what was, and is the will of God; wherein they did, and we should spend our dayes, in walking with God in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, as <hi>Henoch</hi> did, and the other fathers: and sayth the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, <hi>the end of our faith, is the salvation of our soules vnto ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting life;</hi> and therefore <hi>Henoch</hi> the holy, nameth his sonne <hi>Methusala,</hi> which signifieth <hi>long life.</hi> Thus <hi>Henoch</hi> being as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured of the infinite mercies of God towards him and his seede, by faith still beholding as in a glasse, the redemption by the sonne of God, nameth his sonne accordingly <hi>long life:</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause men should not thinke, that any here in this world li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth without calamitie, and least outward happines, should make men forget God, <hi>Methusala</hi> being a Prophet preached of the destruction of the world by the floud, calleth his sonne <hi>Lamech,</hi> which signifieth <hi>strucken</hi> or <hi>heart wounded;</hi> which sheweth that <hi>Lamech,</hi> was outwardly afflicted by men, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly afflicted in conscience by the Devill; and in respect that he being next those times of danger, wherein the world should be drowned, for despising the preaching of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. And though God throweth consciences downe for a while, with griefe of other mens iust punishment, yet he rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth them vp againe, giving them hope of his assured promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and a sweete comfort of eternall life. <hi>Lamech</hi> being thus strengthened by faith, ayming still to the sentence of salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on propounded in Paradice, calleth his sonne, <hi>Noah,</hi> which signifieth <hi>restorer</hi> or <hi>comforter. Noah</hi> was a figure of Christ, and we doe not reade, that God did speake to any of these ten Fathers, but to <hi>Adam</hi> the first, and <hi>Noah</hi> the last of the tenne Fathers, before the floud. He built the Arke a figure of the Church, and therefore he was a figure of Christ, the great builder of the spirituall Church of God. I desire to be as short as I can, and therefore I will here end my discourse of the first age of the Church, in which time all fundamentall truth of
<pb facs="tcp:177007:65"/> religion was taught, which you may conceiue by their signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant names, which is the very religion wee at this day doe professe in this particular Church of great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee are in a true succession, in that which is the life and being of a true visible Church of Christ, and therefore Seni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our <hi>Philip,</hi> I exhort you and all private men, to looke chiefly to the succession of true faith, and doctrine, without which you can haue no hope of salvation, though you haue succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of persons.</p>

               <p>I remember that one of the Apostles sayth, <hi>that God did in times past sundry wayes speake vnto his people, but now at the last, he speakes to vs by his owne sonne:</hi> but I will as well as I can, shew first how God did ordinarily speake to his people in the second age of the Church, which is vnder the Law. In the former age of the Church, the word and lawes of God were ordinarily, as you haue heard delivered by tradition: but as I haue said, the liues of men being shortened, their memories were more weake, and therefore the Lord in mercy delivered his lawes and will by meanes more durable, which was by writing; then he ordained other ordinary Priests, which were successours of the first borne Priests, and these were the Priests of <hi>Levie:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Numb. 12.21</note> and this appeareth in the third of numbers, in these wordes: <hi>and also the Lord spake vnto</hi> Moses <hi>saying; I haue even taken the Levites from among the children of Israell, for all the first borne that openeth the matrix of the children of Israell, and the Levites shall be mine;</hi> and the end was to serue God in the Sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary. Now for this ministring tribe <hi>Levie,</hi> there were degrees among them: for those that came of his son <hi>Kohath,</hi> were the high Priests; and those that came of <hi>Gershom</hi> and <hi>Merari,</hi> were allotted vnto inferior services, as in this booke largely appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: but you must vnderstand that the first borne of the <hi>Koha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thites,</hi> were onely high Priests, as <hi>Aaron,</hi> and the eldest after him lineally by ordinary rule in every Altar duty, as also one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appointed to enter into the holy of holies, and that once a
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:177007:65"/> yeare, these Leviticall Priests, did build the Church of God, vpon the blessed foundation Christ, by the word and lawes of God written, which word and law, was all one with those lawes delivered formerly by tradition,<note place="margin">Exod. 19.5</note> but onely differ'd in the manner of delivery: the Lord did make choise of the Israelits to be his people, as appeareth in the 19 of <hi>Exodus,</hi> in these words: <hi>And now therefore if you will heare my voyce indeede, and keepe my Covenant: then shall you be my cheife treasure aboue all people, though all the earth be mine.</hi> Now when the Lord had made choise of his Church, and Pastors to build the Church vpon Christ the foundation; which builders, were the Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall Priests, and those were the ordinary builders all the time of the Law. The Lord also raised extraordinary builders, which were the Prophets, which were the expounders of the Law, who prophecied also of the Messias to come: and those Prophets did denounce from God, the Iudgements which he threatned against the contemners and breakers of his lawes: they spared none, neither priests, nor people, no, nor the Kings and Rulers, as <hi>Eliah</hi> told <hi>Ahab; Thou and thy fathers house, doe trouble Israel,</hi> and the Prophet <hi>Nathan</hi> told <hi>David</hi> the King, <hi>Thou art the man:</hi> now as God had made choise of his Church, and appointed Pastors and Teachers to build the Church vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Christ the foundation, so also he gaue them lawes, to frame the severall soules of the Church, for his spirituall building. These lawes were of 3 sorts, <hi>Morall, Iudiciall,</hi> and <hi>Ceremonial:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 19.16.17.18.</note> First, for the <hi>Morall</hi> law, with what Maiestie and terror, was it delivered; as in thundring and lightning, and in a thicke cloud vpon the mount, and the sound of a trumpet, very loud, so that all the people were afraid, and the mount <hi>Sina</hi> was all on a smoake, because the Lord came downe vpon it in fire, and the smoake ascended as the smoake of a furnace, and all the mount trembled exceedingly. Now if the Law were delivered with such Maiestie and terror, what shall become of contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of this law, and of those that breake this law, and teach men so to doe, as your Pope,<note place="margin">Math 5.19.</note> and Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doe most fouly, as (God willing) you shall heare hereafter. Now I pray you hearken a little, what I shall say of the <hi>Morall</hi> law and the
<pb facs="tcp:177007:66"/> Gospell together. God cals the <hi>Israelites</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and willeth them to heare his law in these words, God spake all these wordes saying, <hi>I am the Lord thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt.</hi> In the first sentence, you haue the Gospell taught in these words, <hi>thy God;</hi> for by this is vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood the redemption by Christ: for though God in respect that he is the Creator, is God both of the wicked, and the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, yet he never calleth himselfe the God of the wicked: hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto is all the law referred, for all the prophecies in Christ are yea and Amen: this entrance to the Law by the Gospel, is exceeding necessary, for seeing if wee behold the infinite Maiestie of God in our weakenes, there is no cause but of trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling and feare. It pleaseth God in the face of thy godly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, to shew himselfe favourable, and reconciled, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we may approach with boldnes. Now I say, God gaue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so <hi>Iudiciall</hi> lawes, for the politicall government of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth of <hi>Israell,</hi> which <hi>Iudiciall</hi> lawes, were some cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall, some morall, or naturall: as they were ceremoniall, they ended at the death of Christ; but as they are naturall, or morall, they binde alwayes to the ende of the world. Now the Magistrate might doe nothing, but that which he knew to be the will of God, and therefore he was to stand before the high Priest, who shall aske counsell for him, by the iudgement of <hi>Ʋrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim before the Lord, at his word they shall goe out,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Num. 27.28.</note>
                  <hi>and at his word they shall come in, both he, and all the Children of Israel with him, and all the Congregation:</hi> and this wee also hold and teach, that our King and subordinate Magistrates vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him, may doe nothing for the government of the common wealth, but by consulting with God, to know his will by his word. And thus farre we are in a true succession of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Church.</p>

               <p>I answere, that the Iewish Church were taught by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> the redemption by Christ, and this he did by the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall Law. First, of the Tabernacle, there were two places, 1 <hi>The Holy,</hi> 2 <hi>The Holy of holiest,</hi> the holy was called the Sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:177007:66"/> of the world, and the holy of holiest, did represent the state of heaven, it is sayd in the Epistle to the <hi>Heb:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 9.1.9. Heb. 10.1.</note>
                  <hi>That the law was the shadow of good things to come:</hi> and the shadowing law, was the ceremoniall law, as is plaine to be perceived by this 10 Chapter: within the Holy of holiest, was the Arke of the covenant of God, and it was covered, and the covering was called the mercy seate, which figured Christ, who is our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiatory or mercy seate, to cover our sinnes: Over the mercy seate, were the forme of two Angels, having relation to the Angels that kept the way to the tree of life, to shew that none were worthy to come into the Holy of of holiest, but <hi>Aaron</hi> the annointed of the Lord, who likewise figured Christ, both in name and office: in name, for a learned man of ours, sayth that <hi>Aaron</hi> signifieth Christ, which in English is annointed, and in office, by entring once for all, into the Holy of holiest: for it was the high Priests office once every yeare to enter into the Holy of holiest with bloud, of this <hi>David</hi> speakeh, <hi>When he commeth into the world, meaning Christ,</hi> he sayth, <hi>Sacrifice and burnt offerings thou wouldest not haue,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 40.7.</note>
                  <hi>but a body hast thou ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; in the beginning of thy booke, it is written, that I should doe thy will O God, then sayd I, loe I come.</hi> And thus you see how the redemption of Christ, was taught by <hi>Moses.</hi> Now to teach the <hi>Israelites</hi> the way to Christ the Messias, God appointed divers sacrifices, some to be offered vp directly, for expiation for sin: and secondly, some for testifying due thankefulnes vnto God, for favours received. Those sacrifices for sinne, are all those, which brought with them effusion of bloud, and sprinkling of the same: these all, doe figure the bloud of Christ, which should be shed, for the forgiuenes of sinnes, and this is clearely set downe and proved by the Authour to the <hi>Heb: Now the sacrifices that were offered, were of cleane beasts,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb 9.7.11.12 13.14.</note>
                  <hi>signifying that Christ that was to be offered once for all,</hi> should be of absolute per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: It were too tedious to enter into discourse of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers particular sacrifices, for sinnes of Princes and Rulers, Priests and particular people, and for the whole congregation, all which did figure out Christ Iesus, who by his death, and
<pb facs="tcp:177007:67"/> bloudshedding, did offer himselfe to the father, as a perfect sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice well pleasing to God, for the sinnes of the world. Now the Altar that sanctified his offering, was his Deity, the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice which hee offered, was his humanity, and the Priest that offered this acceptable sacrifice, was both natures vnited in one person, Christ both God and man, and thus in briefe as well as I can, I haue shewed you the ceremonies vnder the Law, which taught the <hi>Israelites</hi> the Messias to come.</p>

               <p>I haue shewed you before, that they had <hi>Iudiciall</hi> lawes, for their civill governement. And also the <hi>Morall</hi> law, which is a perfect rule of righteousnes, which no meere man did e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver perfectly performe, but Christ the Messias, (being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect God and perfect man) hath perfectly performed it for all penitent beleevers. And this he did, first, by the inherent ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines of his nature; secondly, by his actiue obedience of his life: thirdly, passiuely in his suffrings; and therefore the Law sheweth vs, what we could haue done in our state of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie, and it sheweth vs what we cannot doe, now in the state of corruption, and therfore it is now a schoole-master, to driue vs to Christ. Now the two resemblances of the heavenly and earthly sanctuary, are a glasse for vs to behold Gods glory in. The heavens resembled by the Holy of holiest, are the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens of God, where he is most specially present: and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, resembleth the Church on earth, where he is present a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst men. In which there be creatures, cleane, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane; the cleane, to represent the godly; the vncleane, the wicked of conversation: and as trees, and all other creatures, differ one from another, so doe the manners of men: and God made beasts, fish, and fowle, to expresse the affection of mens mindes, and gaue liberty to beasts, fish, and fowle, to eate vp one another; but to man, he gaue a Iustice among themselues, and taught them a civill life, by eating of cleane beasts, and forbiddeth grosse behaviour in forbidding to eate vncleane beasts, fishes, and fowles. This distinction of cleane beasts, fishes, and fowles, from vncleane; was appointed by <hi>Moses</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:177007:67"/> law; to distinguish the Iewes, the people of God, from the Gentiles, who were not the people of God, but Heathen. The vncleane beasts forbidden, were Hogs and Dogs, Conie and Hare, Dawe and such like: to shew that we should not be like Hogs, to wallow in the mire of our vncleane conversation; nor like Dogs to returne to the vomit of our former impieties, but hold on in the newnes of a sanctified life, nor like Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, whose nature is to vndermine: but to deale faithfully with our neighbours; that so our conversation may appeare before men, as we may glorifie our father which is in heaven: nor like the Dawe or Crow, which peereth with his eyes, for we ought not to be curious, in looking to other mens faults, but striue to mend our owne,<note place="margin">Math 7.</note> as our Saviour Christ teacheth in the Gospell, <hi>Thou that spiest a mote in thy brothers eye, first pull out the beame out of thine owne.</hi> And of the rest of vncleane beasts, fishes and fowles, something in life is taught to be es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chewed, for the lawfulnes, and vnlawfulnes of eating them. Now there is no doubt, for Christ hath broken downe the wall of seperation, and wee may now freely vse any of them. But the equitie of the same law remaineth still, for the law of God, is eternall. All the cleane, were such as chewed the cud, and parted the hoofe; as Oxe, Sheepe, Goate and Hart, and such like; to teach vs that we ought alwayes to be meditating of the workemanship of heaven and earth, and the rdempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the sonne of God: painefull in our vocation, as Oxen; meeke as Sheepe; hardy as Goates vnder the crosse of Christ; and swift to good with the Hart; that our bodies might be a cleane tabernacle, holy, and vndefiled, fit for the Holy of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est to enter in; so should we be clothed with <hi>Aarons</hi> white gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of perfect justice, and in our bosome retaine the precious Iewell of <hi>Ʋrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> that is light of the knowledge of Christ, and perfection to embrace the same. Thus you see that the Law and all the Ceremonies thereof; the Tabernacle, and all the appertenances thereof; <hi>Aarons</hi> office and attyre, are all to be applyed to the redemption by Christ, the equitie of which Lawes, we in the Church of Great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> doe preach and professe, and therefore we are the true Church and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede

               <p>First, therefore I say that the ceremoniall law vpon the comming of Christ, is disanulled, as is plaine, in the 7. to the <hi>Heb:</hi> in these words,<note place="margin">Heb. 7.18.19.</note>
                  <hi>For the commandement that went afore, is disanulled, because of the weakenes thereof; and vnprafitablenes, for the Law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope, made perfect;</hi> whereby we draw nearer vnto God, for the end of the law was to bring vs to Christ, by whom, we draw neare vnto God. Now that the Priesthood of <hi>Aaron,</hi> is changed, as also the law: looke the 12 verse, the <hi>Leviticall</hi> and <hi>Aaronicall</hi> Priesthood, is vtterly changed, and Christ become our high Priest, and is so for ever; <hi>and that not after the order of Aaron, but for ever after the order of Melchisedech.</hi> And his priesthood cannot passe to any other, because he endureth for ever: now as Christ is our high Priest, so he offered a sacrifice to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for vs, in these words, both in the 40. <hi>Psal.</hi> and in the 10. to the <hi>Heb.

               <p>I will a little speake of the first conversion of this land, and then speake some-what of those which were the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which Christ did vse for its convertion, &amp; then shew the succession of our Ministers lineally, from those first converters. First, I say it is a thing cleare, that our Countrey of Great <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,</hi> received very anciently the Christian faith, as I perceiue,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:177007:69"/> by the booke of succession, written by a learned and reverend Divine of ours, named Master <hi>Francis Mason;</hi> who hath there in, recited many Fathers and Historians, that haue written of the <hi>Brittaines</hi> receiving the Christian faith, in the very spring of the Primitiue Church, their names are these; first, <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret;</hi> and before him, Saint <hi>Ierome;</hi> and before him, Saint <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome;</hi> and before him, <hi>Athanasius;</hi> and before him, <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian;</hi> and before him, <hi>Origen;</hi> and to all these, (the sayd M. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> sayth) agreeth that which <hi>Polidore Virgil</hi> bringeth out o <hi>Gildas,</hi> the most antient writer of our Nation. That <hi>Brittaine,</hi> received the faith, from the first springing of the Gospell: so that at the very dawning of the day, to vs th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

The bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren wildernes of <hi>Brittaine,</hi> became a fruitfull garden, and was graciously watred with the dew of heaven: And thus it was in part fulfilled, which was foretold in the Psalmes, <hi>I will giue thee the Heathen for thine inheritance,</hi>

                  <hi>I haue heard that your Countrey of Great</hi> Brittaine, <hi>haue beene anciently converted to the faith of Christ</hi> 3. <hi>times, and that by</hi> 3. <hi>Bishops of</hi> Rome; <hi>as first, by Saint</hi> Peter: <hi>secondly, by</hi> Eleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therius: <hi>thirdly, by Pope</hi> Gregory: <hi>and that Saint</hi> Peter <hi>came hither in his owne person; and</hi> Eleutherius <hi>and</hi> Gregory <hi>by their Legates.</hi>

               <p>Nay, what if it be proved that the <hi>Brittaines</hi> were Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians before the <hi>Romans:</hi> our learned M. <hi>Mason</hi> sayth, that your Pastors doe proclaime every where, that <hi>Peter</hi> was the first founder of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> but when came S. <hi>Peter</hi> first to <hi>Rome? Baronius</hi> saith, in the yeare of Christ, 44. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the second of the Emperour <hi>Claudius.</hi> Now let vs consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der when our Iland first received the sweete Influence of the Gospell; and here we will follow <hi>Gildas,</hi> who was the most antient Historian of our Nation, and for his wisedome, was surnamed <hi>Sapience,</hi> and for his devotion, and eloquence, may well be termed, the zealous and golden mouth'd <hi>Gildas:</hi> this <hi>Gildas,</hi> declareth, how those frozen Ilands, farre remote from
<pb facs="tcp:177007:70"/> the visible sunne, receiue the glittering beames of Christ Iesus, the invisible sonne. In the time of <hi>Tiberius Cesar,</hi> which is the more remarkeable, because he professeth in the same place, that he pronounceth it vpon sure grounds, and certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. Now <hi>Tiberius</hi> died in the yeare of Christ, 39. according to <hi>Baronius;</hi> whereupon it followeth that the <hi>Brittaine</hi> received the Gospell fiue yeares at least, before either <hi>Paul</hi> or <hi>Peter</hi> came at <hi>Rome,</hi> by which it is manifest, that our first conversion, is not come from <hi>Rome.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Well, I thinke it false what you say; for</hi> Brittain <hi>was conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thrice by those which came from</hi> Rome, <hi>and it is the opinion of our Divines, and especially by father</hi> Parsons <hi>proved, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle S.</hi> Peter, <hi>was the first converter of the</hi> Brittaines <hi>to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian faith.</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>George,</speaker>
               <p>Well, we are now come to those which were the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of this Nation. I know by M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>Masons</hi> booke, that some hold that S. <hi>Peter,</hi> some S. <hi>Paul,</hi> some <hi>Simon Zelotes,</hi> some <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristobilus,</hi> and some <hi>Ioseph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea,</hi> and that you amongst you hold it the best opinion, that S. <hi>Peter</hi> did first convert our Natiō. It seemeth that many of the Apostolical men, were here in <hi>Brittaine</hi> in the Primitiue time. But we cannot make it an Article of faith, which of them did first convert this Land, yet it is more probable, that the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> rather then the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle <hi>Peter,</hi> did first convert this Nation to the faith, or <hi>Simon</hi> of <hi>Canani,</hi> both which were Apostles, and had commission not from <hi>Peter,</hi> but from Christ immediately; and verily that S. <hi>Paul</hi> was here, is a point not without probabilitie; for he was the Apostle to the <hi>Gentiles. In labours abundant, in perils often, and that by Sea.</hi> He was a starre swiftly gliding from East to West; a herauld proclaiming the acceptable day of the Lord. But we are of opinion, and thinke it is most probable of all, that <hi>Ioseph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea,</hi> who was sent hither by <hi>Philip</hi> the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle out of <hi>France,</hi> with ten others of his companions; and this <hi>Ioseph</hi> was the first that did convert our Nation to the Christian faith, and he did obtaine a place here of the King, where he and his company did reside, as in a Monastery; which place to this day is called <hi>Glassenbury.</hi> This was that <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph</hi>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:177007:70"/> which buryed the blessed body of our Saviour Christ in his Sepulchre, in his garden. He afterward became a Preacher of the Resurrection; In <hi>Glassenbury</hi> he poured out his pretious oyntment, and all <hi>Brittaine</hi> was filled with the sweetnesse of the Odour. Now whither he was the first Preacher in <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,</hi> we cannot define; But if he were the first, then the first converter came from <hi>Arimathea,</hi> and not from <hi>Rome,</hi> being sent by <hi>Philip,</hi> and not by S. <hi>Peter.</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>George,</speaker>
               <p>This is not to be called a conversion of our Nation, but rather a new supply of Preachers, and further propagation of the Gospell. All the severall orders of your Priests, let them beat their heads together, and they shall never be able to proue that the Gospell and faith of Iesus Christ, was ever since wholy extirpated out of this Island, since the first plantation in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles times.</p>

               <speaker>Philip,</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>It may be, the faith was professed by some private Christian<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, but not by the King, nor any induced by his authoritie; for himselfe, he was not a Christian, but sent vnto Pope</hi> Elutherius, <hi>that by his commandement he might be made a Christian.</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>George,</speaker>
               <p>In that he wrote his Epistle to that purpose, you may see the motion proceeded from his owne breast, and not from the Preaching of <hi>Elutherius;</hi> he was already made a Christian by the Baptisme of the spirit, and was desirous to be made so by the Baptisme of water; he had already entred himselfe into the schoole of Christ, &amp; sought meanes that his whole kingdome might follow after, which argueth that his soule was sanctified with grace. It is truth by History, as it seemes to me, that King <hi>Lucius</hi> did send to <hi>Elutherius,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> one <hi>Elvanus,</hi> who was brought vp at <hi>Glassenbury,</hi> and who did disperse through the wide fields of <hi>Brittain,</hi> those first seeds of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell sowne by <hi>Ioseph.</hi> It is recorded by history, that <hi>Elutherius</hi> made <hi>Elvanus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Brittaine,</hi> and one <hi>Meduinus,</hi> who went to <hi>Rome</hi> with <hi>Elvanus,</hi> Doctor, to Preach the faith of Christ through the whole Island; which sheweth that when they were sent Embassadours to <hi>Elutherius,</hi> they were no No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vises,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:177007:71"/> but profound Divines, and practised Teachers in the Schoole of Christ, as they are termed by one of your owne Historians, as M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>: <hi>Mason</hi> saith. Thus it appeareth that there were learned Preachers, which had sowne the seeds of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell through the whole Island, even at the time of <hi>Elutherius</hi> sending.</p>

               <p>I answer; when the King desired to receiue the <hi>Romane</hi> lawes, the Bishop returned this answer, That there were alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die in <hi>Brittaine</hi> the old and new Testament, out of which by the Councell of his kingdome, he might take a law to governe his kingdome and people; for he was the Vicar of Christ in his owne kingdome.

               <p>Then you doe confesse asmuch as I would haue you, you say right that <hi>Cranmor</hi> was a true Bishop, and that he had power to giue orders to others. And according to his office he did ordaine other Bishops, and they had power to ordaine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers accordingly. This power hath successiuely continued in our Church most truly according to the <hi>Cannon</hi> of the church, to this very day; for <hi>Cranmor</hi> was ordained by authority, from the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> by three <hi>Popish</hi> Bishops, and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Metropolitane:</hi> by the assistance of other Bishops, did or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine other Bishops all the raigne of <hi>King Henry</hi> the eight. And when the happy time came, of Gods mercifull provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and goodnesse to this Nation, that there should be a more perfect reformation in King <hi>Edwards</hi> dayes, the Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Priesthood was taken away. Yet such Bishops as were ordained in King <hi>Henryes</hi> time, by <hi>Cranmor</hi> and other Bishops assistance, as would renounce Popery, were still Bishops in King <hi>Edwards</hi> dayes without reordination: and so likewise, some Bishops in King <hi>Edwards</hi> dayes, that turned to Popery, were received &amp; continued Bishops in Queene <hi>Maryes</hi> daies, without reordination. And also in Queene <hi>Elizabeths</hi> dayes, Popish Bishops renouncing Popery, still continued Bishops, without reordination. As for example, I will name one, by name <hi>Antony Kitchin,</hi> a man more fitt to be a Scullion in a kit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chin then a Bishop of soules. Yet I hope God gaue him repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cance, because he died in the blessed time of reformation. In

And therefore this should stopp the mouthes and stay the penns also of your wicked writters a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst our Church, especially of that fearefull vilde Libellour.

                  <hi>What you haue hitherto sayed in defence of your Bishops, to proue the lawfullnesse of them, is nothing, because to the very being of a Bishop: the order of Priesthood, is especially required which is not to be found in the Church of England, and therefore the want of Priesthood over-throweth the very essence of your Bishops.</hi>

               <p>I answer if you meane no more by Priests, then the holy Ghost doth by Presbyter, that is, the minister of the newe Testament, then we professe, and are ready to proue that our Bishops and Ministers are such, as they are called, in the booke of Common prayers, and forme of ordering, because they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue in their ordination, authority to preach the word of God, and to administer the holy Sacraments. Secondly, if by Priests, you meane sacrificing Priests, and would expound your selues of spirituall sacrifices; then this name as it belongs to all Christians, so it may be applyed to the Ministers, but if you meane by a priest, a sacrificer vnto God, for the quicke and the dead; whereby the Ministers of the new Testament are Priests properly: and in the Sacrament, he offers Christs body and bloud to God the father, really, properly, or bodily for the remission of sinnes. This Priesthood, and your Masses, for the quicke and the dead, the Church of England condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth as blasphemous, false, and dangerous deceits. The Church of England teacheth thus according to the Scriptures; <hi>viz.</hi> the offring of Christ, once made, is that perfect redemption, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation and satisfaction for all the sinnes of the whole world, both originall and actuall, and there is no other satisfaction, but that alone once made: <hi>And that Christ offered himselfe but once,</hi> looke <hi>Heb.</hi> 9 15. and verse 10. and that Christ is the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Priest, having an eternall priesthood, which cannot passe
<pb facs="tcp:177007:75"/> from him to any other, looke <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.24.25. And thus I haue proved our Church, by your marke of succession, both of place and persons, to be a true Church of Christ; but princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally by our marke, which is infallible, that is succession of doctrine. Now for our succession of Bishops from King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the 8. till this day; It cannot with honesty be denied, as I haue before declared, and is confessed in generall by one of yours, whose name is <hi>Cudsemius,</hi> who came into England in the yeare of our Lord, 1608. to obserue the state of our Church, and the orders of our Vniversities; concerning the state saith he, of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he <hi>Calvinian</hi> seat in England, it so standeth, that it may either endure long, or be changed suddenly in a trice: In regard of the Catholike order therein, a perpetuall line of their Bishops, and the lawfull succession of Pastors, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the Church. Behold he confesseth we haue the Catholike order. Secondly, a perpetuall line of Bishops. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, a lawfull succession of Pastors, and that derived from the Church: But withall I would haue you to know, that though our Bishops and Pastors received it from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet with a double difference. For first, <hi>Cranmor</hi> and the rest received their orders from Popish Bishops, in a Popish man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, defiled with many popish pollutions; but when it pleased God to open their eyes, they pared away the pollutions, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining that which was good, delivered it to posteritie. So our Pastors succeede yours in their orders not simply, but to farre as they are agreeable to the Scriptures, for the man of sinne did sit in the Temple of God; and <hi>Antechrist</hi> had vsurped the chaire of Christ, even in this kingdome, so that then good things &amp; bad were mingled together. Therefore in that which yours received frō Christ, our Pastors willingly succeed them. In that which your Bishops received from <hi>Antichrist,</hi> ours doe renounce and disclaime. Secondly, <hi>Cranmor</hi> and the rest, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved shels of succession, without carnels of true doctrine: for though your Church did giue power to preach the truth, yet being bewitched with <hi>Antichrist</hi> in many things, it did not reveale the truth: but when God by the scriptures revealed it vnto them, they both preached it themselues, and cōmended
<pb facs="tcp:177007:75"/> it to posterity. Neither was this by schisme to leape out of the Church, but out of corruption in the Church; even as the wheat carnell, when it is cleansed, leapeth not out of the Barne, but out of the chaffe.</p>

                  <hi>The Scripture is full of proofes and testimonies, declaring both his lawfull authority, and his due execution thereof. First, for his authority, the promise of the Keyes, and the commission of feeding the sheepe doth proue it directly. First, for the promise of the keyes; These wordes declare, which our Saviour Christ spake to</hi> Peter, I will giue thee the keyes of the Kingdome of heaven;<note place="margin">Mat. 16.19.</note>
                  <hi>Christ gaue him not one, but two keyes,</hi> viz. <hi>the key of knowledge, and the key of power. First, by the key of knowledge, he was able to open all Scripture and controversies of Religion: Secondly, he had the key of power, and this is of Order and Iurisdiction: by this key, he was able to ordaine Bishops and Pastors of the Church; and againe to locke them out of the Ministerie, by deposing and degrading as occasion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired;
<pb facs="tcp:177007:76"/> by the key of Iurisdiction, he might open and shut both the outward court, by excommunications, absolution, dispensation, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling generall counsels &amp;c. and the court of conscience, by forgiving and retaining sinnes. In a word, in these keyes, all ecclesiasticall pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er was comprehended, and given to</hi> Peter.</p>

               <speaker>George,</speaker>
               <p>I will make a little preamble before I come to dispute, and discusse these points. This is our happines in our Church, that although Sathan, hath greatly prevailed with vs, that many of our Pastours, Governors, and people, haue run into scandall to the great griefe of the godly of our religion, by an vngodly, and dissolute, and corrupted course of life, which haue caused our enemies to blaspheame our holy reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: Yet he hath not prevailed, since the time of our happy and blessed reformation, to be a lying spirit in the mouthes of our Pastours and Prophets: and if at any time he hath prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with some private Ministers, to broach any dangerous er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, presently he is refelled by the Iudicious and godly Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours of our Church, and that by the sword of the spirit, which is the word of God, and blessed be God, our Iudicious and wise King, together with the subordinate civill powers vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him. By the sword of Magistracy, doe joyne with them to the suppressing of such errors, if at any time, they be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely preached amongst vs. But such is the fearefull estate of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> through Gods just judgment, that Sathan hath prevailed to be a lying spirit, in the mouthes of the most of their Pastours, and that for many hundred of yeares toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And therefore I would wish you Signior <hi>Philip,</hi> and all private men, to try by the blessed and infallible touch-stone of the written word of God, the spirit of the Church, whither it be of God or not. For you shall finde, that that Church, by the Doctrine thereof, doth oppose the truth of God, revealed by his sonn Christ Iesus our Lord, in many grounds of saving truth, especially by this point of the supremacie of <hi>Peter,</hi> over
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:177007:76"/> the rest of the Apostles. And his supposed succession the Popes of <hi>Rome,</hi> ouer the Catholike Church, and the whole World. Therefore let vs seriously consider those last recited scriptures, for the proofe of the Pops supremacy, out of which I say, you cannot conclude his jurisdiction.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Marry the place which I last recited was in this words.</hi> Vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this rocke will I build my Church, <hi>which words are meant of Peter; therefore hee is the rocke and the foundation of the Church.</hi>

               <p>I deny that <hi>Peter</hi> is the rocke of the Church,<note place="margin">Reue. 11.14</note> but I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse that he is a rocke of the Church, as the rest of the Apostles and Prophets were. For the Church is founded vpon the Doctrine of the Apostles, <hi>Iesus Christ being the head corner stone.</hi> Now I say, that both <hi>Peter,</hi> and the rest of the Apostles and Prophets, were not in their persons foundation stones, but in respect of their Doctrine and ministry, for Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe aboue, is the personall and essentiall foundation of the Church, and it is no better then blasphemy to make any other person; or persons to be the rocke and foundation of the Church. If the Pope wil needs be a rocke or foundation of the Church, let him doe as <hi>Peter</hi> and the rest of the Apostles, and all good Pasttours doe, viz. Vphold the Church by a constant preaching of wholsome and sound Doctrine, else hee is not so much as a little stone in the building: But this is to hard a taske for him.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>George,</speaker>
               <p>I haue told you before, that Christ the sonne of God, the second person in Trinity, being perfect God and man, is the foundation of the Church, and so is, and ever hath beene, and ever shall be the strong foundation of the Church: the Metaphor of rocke and stone, is vsed to shew the strength and everlasting continuance of this, building, the Apostles and Prophets, and all faithfull teachers, are all by their pure and vncorrupted Doctrine ministeriall foundations of this build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and all faithfull Christians are stones of this building: but <hi>Iesus Christ is the head corner stone,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.5. 1 Pet. 2 6.7. Act. 4.11.</note> which the whole frame of the Church in all ages, did rest vpon. Now I will come to the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:177007:77"/> text you last alledged: There was a question there propsed by Christ, to all his Apostles, and not to <hi>Peter</hi> alone, whom saith our Saviour, <hi>say ye that I am?</hi> This question was answered by <hi>Peter,</hi> in the name of all the rest: Thou art the sonne of the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God. Wherevpon in the 18: verse saith our Saviour, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this rocke will I build my Church. Now your Church doth vnderstand it of <hi>Peter,</hi> and ours, vpon the object of <hi>Peter</hi> and the other Apostles faith, which was Christ to bee the Son of the living God. Now considering that the Apostle hath said, as I haue before related; that other foundation can no man lay, then that which is laid, which is Iesus Christ, and he being in many places of scriptures called the head corner stone of the Church, and the foundation of the Church; Then I marvell the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> dare interpret it the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of <hi>Peter</hi> and his successors: doe they not see they make our Saviour an vnperfect rocke and foundation of the Church, when they add to him the person of <hi>Peter,</hi> and his supposed successors as a supply?</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Well, to the other words of our Saviour,</hi> whom say ye that I am? <hi>This question was answered by</hi> Peter <hi>in these words,</hi> Thou art Christ the sonne of the living God: <hi>our Saviour telleth</hi> Peter <hi>that he was happy, and in the</hi> 18: <hi>verse, thou art</hi> Peter, <hi>and vpon this rocke will I build my Church;</hi> and the gates of hell shall not prevaile against it. <hi>And I will giue thee the keyes of the kingdome of heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt binde on earth, shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt lose on earth, shalbe losed in heaven. These words doe shew that</hi> Peter <hi>had a greater Iurisdiction and power then all the other Apostles, and therefore he had a supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy aboue them all.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>George,</speaker>
               <p>I answer that the keyes were given to the rest of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles as well as to <hi>Peter;</hi> for the question being proposed by our Saviour, <hi>whom say ye that I? am</hi> the answere was made by <hi>Peter,</hi> thou art Christ the sonne of the living God. Wherevpon M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>: <hi>Mason</hi> saith, that S. <hi>Austin</hi> observed that <hi>Peter</hi> alone made answere for all the Apostles: and his observation is according to the scriptures, which testifieth that <hi>Peter</hi> before this time had answered in the name of them all. <hi>We beleeue and know that
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:177007:77"/> thou art the Christ the sonne of the living God.</hi> Now as <hi>Peter</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth one for all, so Christ said to <hi>Peter,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iohn 6.69.</note> and in him to them all. <hi>I will giue you the keyes of the kingdom of heaven.</hi> Thus the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers interpret the place, as <hi>Austin, Peter</hi> receaved the keyes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with them all; &amp; <hi>Ierom,</hi> they al receiue the keyes; &amp; <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen,</hi> the keyes were common to al; &amp; <hi>Hillary,</hi> they obtained the keyes of the kingdome of heauen; and <hi>Ambrose;</hi> what is said to <hi>Peter,</hi> is said to the Apostles. This consent of the Fathers, should over-balance your opinion against the counsell of <hi>Trent.</hi> Indeede your Priests and Iesuits, make the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that you will be judged by the Fathers; But when it commeth to the tryall, your Priests forsake them. The Fathers must be pretended for a fashion: but your holy father the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> is the very needle and compasse, whereby you sayle. I might further reason with you by Maister <hi>Masons</hi> booke; where it is proved both by scriptures, and by Fathers, and by your owne writers, that the rest of the Apostles received their Iurisdiction immediately from Christ, and not from <hi>Peter;</hi> But I will giue you some short and invincible arguments to shew you, that the rest of the Apostles had equall power, with the Apostle Saint <hi>Peter.</hi>

               <p>I pray God that I may be truely simple and innocent in the Lords cause without deceit. Our Saviour Christ after his ascension gaue gifts vnto men, for the repairing of the Saints, by the worke of the Ministry, and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> nameth their Offices; which were <hi>some Apostles, some Prophets, some Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists, some Pastors and Teachers.</hi> I marvell,<note place="margin">Ephe. 4.11.</note>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> in this place left out the Vicar general; he that is the ministeriall head, &amp; Christs Deputy of the Catholike Church: Why did he not mention him in this place, it being so fitting, if there had beene any such great office? Sure here it was meete, that he should haue beene mentioned with his gifts, fitting so great a place, this argueth, surely there is no such office, and therefore wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject it.</p>
               <p>The Second reason or argument is this, Christ is perfect God
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:177007:78"/> together with the Father, and the Holy Ghost; and so he hath Vice-gerents, to governe the world; as namely, Kings and Princes, and they are his Instruments, for he saith, <hi>by me Kings raigne, and decree Iustice:</hi> but Christ is also a Mediator of his redeemed ones; a King of his Church and chosen ones: and in this office, he hath neither fellow nor deputy. For none is capable of this office: if he should haue a fellow, as you in your Religion, make your Popes to be, he should be then an vnperfect Mediator, and he can haue no Deputy; for what man can <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ee capable of his offices, to doe in the roome and stead of Christ, that which he doth? because his workes, are workes of a Mediator, which are compound workes, arising of the effects of his two natures, concurring in one, and the same ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, both from his Godhead, and from his manhood, and therefore to the effecting of this worke, there must necessarily be required an infinite power, which far exceeds the strength of any created nature. The third reason, may be drawne from his blessed promise, of his blessed presence, Christ saith all pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is given vnto mee in heaven and on earth. <hi>Goe therefore,</hi> saith he to the Apostles, <hi>and teach all Nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, Sonne, and Holy Ghost, teaching them to obserue all things whatsoever I haue commanded you:</hi> which is else where, commanded by other phrases; <hi>as feeding his sheepe,</hi> and to the worke of feeding his sheepe, and teaching, and baptizing. In the last verse, he saith, <hi>Loe I am with you, to the end of the world;</hi> and else hee sayth, <hi>where</hi> 2. <hi>or</hi> 3. <hi>are ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.</hi> Now seeing hee is present in especiall manner by promise, what neede he to haue a Deputy, of an vniversall Iurisdiction, to supply his absence. <hi>Ergo,</hi> there is no such Iurisdiction nor supremacy given to <hi>Peter,</hi> and his supposed successors the Popes. Nay in the exercise of the keyes of binding and loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, and excommunications, the Pastors and Church are but his Instruments, and he himselfe the principall agent. The 4. argument is this, when the sonnes of <hi>Zebedeus</hi> sued vnto Christ for the greatest roomes of honour in his Kingdome, thinking hee should be an earthly King, Christ answereth them, <hi>Ye know, that the Lords of the Gentiles haue dominion, and
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:177007:78"/> they that are great, exercise authoritie over them, but it shall not be so with you:</hi> Will you heare what M. <hi>Perkins</hi> saith out of an ancient Father, speaking against one of your Popes, <hi>Eugenius</hi> by name; the Father was Saint <hi>Bernard,</hi> who applyed these wordes to Pope <hi>Eugenius, It is plaine,</hi> saith <hi>Bernard, that here dominion is forbidden the Apostles.</hi> Goe to then, dare if you will, to take vpon you ruling an Apostleship; or in your Apostle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, rule or dominion: if you will haue both alike, you shall loose both, otherwise you must not thinke your selfe exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the number of them, of whom the Lord complaineth thus, they haue raigned, but not of me: they haue beene, but I haue not knowne them. It is cleere by that which hath beene sayd, that <hi>Peter</hi> the Apostle had no power of Iurisdiction o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the rest of the Apostles; nor over the Catholike Church, no further then the rest of the Apostles had; for they all had equally authority immediately from Christ, <hi>to preach, and bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize all nations.</hi> Your learned Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himselfe, doth confesse that all the Apostles receiue their Iurisdiction immediately from Christ, and therefor not from S. <hi>Peter.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Philip,</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>We confesse that all receiue the keyes, but Christ gaue them</hi> Peter <hi>immediately, to the rest by</hi> Peter. <hi>So all power both of order, and iurisdiction proceeded from</hi> Peter.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>George,</speaker>
               <p>But your learned cardinall by foure arguments proveth, that they all receiued their jurisdiction immediately from Christ; First he proveth it by these words of Christ. As my father sent me, so I send you; which exposition hee strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth by the authorities of <hi>Chrysostom, Theophylact, Cyrill,</hi> and <hi>Cyprian.</hi> By the evidence whereof, he affirmeth that the same things were given to the Apostles, by these words; <hi>I send you,</hi> which was promised to <hi>Peter</hi> by these words. I will giue thee the keyes, and after delivered by these words; <hi>feede my sheepe:</hi> And addeth, it is cleare that by these; <hi>I will giue thee the keyes:</hi> and by this saying, <hi>feede my sheepe;</hi> there is vnderstood a most full jurisdiction even in the outward court. Secondly, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth it by <hi>Matthias,</hi> who was neither elect by the Apostles, nor received any authority by them: But being elected by God, was presently accounted amongst the Apostles; and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:177007:79"/> saith he; If all the Apostles had their jurisdiction from <hi>Peter,</hi> that should haue bin manifested most of all in <hi>Matthias.</hi> Thirdly, he proveth it by Saint <hi>Paul;</hi> who professeth that he had his jurisdiction from Christ, and thence confirmeth his Apostle-ship;<note place="margin">Gala. 1.1. verse 15.</note> for he saith, <hi>Paul an Apostle, not of man, nor by man, but by Iesus Christ. Gal:</hi> 1.1. <hi>verse</hi> 15. And that he might declare that he received no authority from <hi>Peter,</hi> or any other Apostle, he saith; <hi>When it pleased God which had seperated me from my mothers wombe: and called me by his grace, to reveale his sonne in me, that I should preach him among the Gentils. Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly I communicated not with flesh and bloud; neither, came I againe to Ierusalem, to them which were Apostles before mee. But I went into</hi> Arabia, <hi>and turned againe to</hi> Damascus, <hi>then after</hi> 3. <hi>yeares I came againe to</hi> Ierusalem, <hi>to visit Peter.</hi> And againe hee saith; To me those that seemed to be some-thing, conferred nothing. Fourthly and lastly, he proveth it, because the Apostles were made onely by Christ, and yet had jurisdiction; As appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. First, by Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> Excommunicating the <hi>Corinthians.</hi> Secondly, by the same <hi>Paul,</hi> making Ecclesiasticall lawes. Thirdly, because the Apostolike dignity, is the highest digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the Church; wherefore it is evident, that the rest of the Apostles received not their power of jurisdiction from <hi>Peter,</hi> but from Christ. Thus you may see what a dangerous thing it is to receiue Articles of faith from the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> yea, though they seeme to produce them out of scripture. Much more when shee vrgeth articles of faith of her owne hatching without scripture. Therefore we that are private men, had neede to be carefull to try all things, and keepe that which is good; as the Apostle adviseth, least we be deceived.</p>

               <p>Then the Pope doth ill, to adorne himselfe with Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolique titles; his Sea Apostolique, his Legat Apostolique, his Pardon Apostolique, his Seale Apostolique, his Bull Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stalque, and all Apostalique. Thus you see by his lying titles, what manner of head hee is of the Catholike Church; what a misery is this to the Church? Yea, his office is an Apostle ship, Causes must be heard by his Apostle-ship; Weighty matters must be reserued to his Apostle-ship; Bishops must visite the Threshold of the Apostles, vnlesse they be dispensed withall, by the Apostles, and that is by the Pope. I will say no more, what Master <hi>Masons</hi> booke relates of his wicked titles, but this I will say out of his booke; that we hope, God will raise such Angels in our Church, as he was in the Church of <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus:</hi> Of whom it is written, that he had tryed them; who say they are Apostles and are not, and had found them lyers. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we proceede any further in reasoning about the power of the Pope, I will shew you wherein the Bishops and Pastours doe succeede the Apostles, and wherein they doe not. For this I would haue you consider with me, that in the Apostles, some things were extraordinary, and some things ordinary. They had 4. Extraordinary prerogatiues. First, they were Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately called by Christ himselfe. Secondly, they had an vnlimited commission, to teach and baptize all nations. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they had an infallible direction by the Spirit, both in prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and in writing that they could not erre. Fourthly, they had power to worke Myracles. All which were necessary for the first planting of Churches, but were not all conveyed to posterity by succession. Other things they had, which were necessary for the Church in all future ages; in which they had successors. As first, they had power to minister the word and Sacraments; wherein every private Minister succeeded them. Secondly, they ordained ministers, executed censures,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:177007:80"/> and other things belonging to the government of the Church, wherein every Bishop succeeded them; so that in the latter, the rest had successors as well as <hi>Peter.</hi> In the former, the rest of the Apostles had no successors: no more had <hi>Peter.</hi>

               <p>Not one of all these points is true but false, I pray ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue, that <hi>Peter</hi> spoke not first, is cleare by these words; when there had Bin much disputation, <hi>Peter</hi> rose vp and sayd; and that he spake not last,<note place="margin">Act. 15.7. verse 12.13. &amp; 20.</note> appeareth also. For the text mentioneth no speech of his but one; after him spoke <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas:</hi> and then Saint <hi>Iames;</hi> and the Counsell concluded the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter according to the word of Saint <hi>Iames,</hi> yea, according to a speciall point, not mentioned by Saint <hi>Peter;</hi> neither were the acts of the Counsell set out in the name of <hi>Peter,</hi> but a <hi>Synodall</hi> Epistle was sent from them all; neither did Saint <hi>Peter</hi> sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe vnto it; I <hi>Peter,</hi> the Vicar of Christ, the Prince of the Apostles, the visible head, and ordinary Pastor of the Church; but he was onely put in amongst the rest, in these words; <hi>It seemeth good vnto the holy Ghost and vnto vs.</hi> Where is now his supreame authority?<note place="margin">verse 28.</note> If ever he should haue challenged it, this had bin the time; this was the place: especially seeing he was present, not by his legat, but in his owne person.

And as the Apostolicall <hi>Synods</hi> recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not their authority from him, so neither did the Apostles themselues, severally considered; as is evident in Saint <hi>Paule,</hi> excommunicating the incestuous <hi>Corinthian;</hi> see by what au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority he did it,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 5.3.</note> I verily saith Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> as absent in body, but present in spirit, haue determined already as though I were present, that he that hath so done this deede in the name of

               <p>Then thus I conclude, that after <hi>Peters</hi> death, there was long a greater jurisdiction in the Church; then <hi>Peter</hi> confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle of Christ (as Saint <hi>Ierom</hi> saith and witnesseth vnto vs) lived 68. yeares after the passion of Christ; and consequently dyed in the yeare of Christ, 101. Which according vnto <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronius,</hi> one of your owne writters, was in the ninth yeare of <hi>Clement,</hi> who was the third Pope after <hi>Peter.</hi> Now Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> by this account, vsed his jurisdiction of Apostle-shipe, which was the greatest, spirituall jurisdiction vnder Christ. All the time of <hi>Linus</hi> and <hi>Cletus,</hi> and to the ninth yeare of <hi>Clement;</hi> which plainly overthroweth your opinion; that the Popes were the greatest in jurisdiction over the Catholike Church after <hi>Peters</hi> death. But let me aske you a question, did S. <hi>Iohn</hi> lose his Apostle-ship after the death of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> and was glad to light his candle againe from <hi>Linus,</hi> and after his death, from <hi>Cletus;</hi> and after his, from <hi>Clements?</hi> If this be so, then there was after the death of Christ whilst an Apostle lived, a greater jurisdiction in the Church, then the jurisdiction of an Apostle, which cannot be.

               <p>I know you all bragg of suceession of place and persons, but as for succession of Doctrine, which is the life of a true Church, what is become of that?

But for your braggs of place and persons, it is but as the shell of a nut, when the divellish Wormes haue eate out the kernell; or as a faire Casket, when the Iewells are stolne; but come, Who was <hi>Peters</hi> immediate succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>George,</speaker>
               <p>But you cannot proue this by <hi>Peters</hi> Doctrine in his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles, nor in the Apostles Acts, nor in the Epistles of any of the other Apostles; therefore not to be beleeved as an Article of faith, and vndoubted truth. And as for the histories of it, they are vncertaine; for the Popes decrees say, <hi>Clement</hi> was his next successor; and <hi>Eusebus</hi> say, <hi>Linus.</hi> And as it is vncertaine which was his first successor, so it is vncertaine, when <hi>Peter</hi> came first to <hi>Rome.</hi> For <hi>Orosius</hi> saith, <hi>

<pb facs="tcp:177007:84"/> principle. There was once a Woman-Pope, whose name properly was <hi>Gilberta,</hi> a Dutch woman of <hi>Ments</hi> or <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guntia,</hi> which is contrary to the Scripture; which permitteth not a Woman to beare rule in the Church of God. If she were, as the histories report, Pope, then they were no Popes and Pastors which she did ordaine; and their orders were meere Nullities. Then what can all them, that haue succeeded her since, be; but meere Lay-men? For she being a Woman, could not be Pope or Bishop: For shee was vncapable, either to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue or giue orders. So hauing nothing to giue in matter of orders, those which she ordained received nothing; so all the Bishops which haue succeeded lineally since her regency, had no power consequently to giue orders one to another. What man of true sanctified judgemēt, will rely his soule vpon the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe of so dangerous an Article, that all the Popes since <hi>Peters</hi> death, were true Popes, and heads of the Catholike Church?</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>But our Church doth deny, that there was any such Woman, Pope, because that histories, where such a woman Pope is recorded, were made</hi> 2 <hi>or</hi> 300. <hi>yeares since such a woman Pope should be, and therefore vncertaine; and there vpon they vtterly deny, that there was any such woman Pope.</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>George,</speaker>
               <p>I haue heard that they vtterly deny that there was any such Pope, vpon the ground you speake off; but the Woman being made Pope, was named Pope <hi>Iohn,</hi> and was in the ranke and catologue of the Popes; but now they haue spunged her out in their best endevours. But I thinke they cannot but must needes haue her in the ranke, or else the linkes of your succession will breake. A learned Divine of ours saith out of your owne authors, that there was in <hi>Rome</hi> a schisme held 39. yeares, one Pope against another; at length the counsell of <hi>Constance,</hi> put downe those false Popes; and to another gaue the Popedome. This must needes be granted, that during the raigne of those false Popes, there was a breach in your successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I reade that in the yeare 1083. and 1058. and 1062. there were 2 Popes together; I reade also that <hi>Benedict</hi> the 9. <hi>Silvester</hi> the 3. and <hi>Gregory</hi> the 6. were Popes all at one time. And at an other time, <hi>Benedict</hi> the 13. a Spanish Pope, &amp; <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi>
                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:177007:84"/> the 12. a <hi>French</hi> Pope, and <hi>Iohn</hi> the 23. an <hi>Italian</hi> Pope, all together; what manner of succession is this, thinke you? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is no good marke of a visible Church, without successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Doctrine; which is the surest and infalliblest marke. <hi>Manasses</hi> polluted the Church, and violated Iustice: and yet he succeeded good <hi>Ezechias</hi> his father; and <hi>Iosiah</hi> reformed the Church, and renued the lawes; yet was Grand-child to, and succeeded that wicked <hi>Manasses.</hi> The same also may happen in the succession of Prelats in the Church: Againe, if any Church might ever alledge the succession of Pastors, it was the Church of the Iewes, for it was in the house of <hi>Aaron;</hi> from Father to Sonne, and none that was out of the same house, might ever sacrifice; besides, there was a promise made vnto them, that they should continue so for ever. And indeede when the Prophets exhorted them to a reformation, they had this in their mouthes: <hi>The law shall not perish from the Priests;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ierem 18 18. Ierem. 8 8.</note>
                  <hi>nor counsell from the wise, nor the Word from the Prophets.</hi> But what saith the spirit of God vnto them? <hi>Say not we are wise,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The Law of the Lord is with vs, &amp;c.</hi>

And againe, <hi>The prophaning of the service of the highest is gon foorth from them.</hi> And againe, <hi>the Lawe shall perish from the Priests, and counsell from the Ancients.</hi> I will end with one text more: the Scribes and Pharises could boast to our Saviour Christ, <hi>That they were the seede of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham:</hi> I know it well, saith our Sauiour,<note place="margin">Ioh. 8.33. &amp; 44.</note> but the Devill is your Father; as Almighty God said to the Children of <hi>Israell:</hi> thy father is an <hi>Amorite,</hi> and thy mother a <hi>Hittite.</hi> And now to drawe to a conclusion, of our reasoning about succession: Me thinkes by the light of naturall reason, that succession of place and person, should not be a true marke of a true visible Church, without succession of true Doctrine. Take a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall reason or two, as for example: A filthy trotting Iade, may succeede in one and the selfe same stable, in the possession of one and the selfe same man. A faire through pac't Gelding,
<pb facs="tcp:177007:85"/> to the prejudice of the owner, and them that shall vse him. A wicked man oft succeedeth a good man, in one and the selfe same house and family, to the prejudice of the family; by his vnlawfull tyrannous vsage. And so a wicked Magistrate, may succeede a good; as before you haue heard. But if a good Horse, faire and fat, and well pac't, succeede another good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; there is no prejudice to the Master, nor to any that haue right to vse him: And if a good man succeede a good man in a f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mily, there is no hurt, but joy &amp; comfoat to the family: For the good governmēt is continued, the maintenance of the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is not wasted with the riotous excesse, but rather encreased to the joy &amp; comfort of all. Now I say, if there doe succeede in the Church, wicked Pastors, which doe vnder the colour of personall succession, bring into the Church, poysoned Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of their owne inventing, whereby the poore sheepe of Christ are in danger to be infected, to the losse of Gods favour in their salvation; Shall the Pastors personall succession ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse their bringing into the Church such wicked Doctrine? Or shall this personall succession excuse the people for recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving such wicked Doctrine? What man of reason will thinke it an excuse for either? No, no, it is the succession of sound Doctrine according to the law of God; which is the onely thing necessary for all pople to looke vnto in succession: and therefore personall succession, is vaine and wicked to be alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged without it, to bee a true marke of the visible Church of God. I will end our discourse of succession, with some me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable sayings I haue read to be in the Fathers. And first, what saith <hi>Nazianzene,</hi> the succession of the Sea, hath nothing else but the name; the true, and reall succession, is that of the saith. And what saith Saint <hi>Basill</hi> of the Church, which defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the Doctrine and the Sacraments. It may very well bee said, how is the faithfull Cittie become a Harlot? And Saint <hi>Ambrose,</hi> they haue not the succession of <hi>Peter,</hi> which haue not the faith of <hi>Peter.</hi> And Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> saith of the Prelats of his time, those O Lord are formost to persecute thee, that seeme to hold the formost place in the Church: It is a small matter for our Watch-men not to guide vs, except they also destroy vs.</p>

Now the church on her part, doth vnite her selfe vnto Christ her head by faith, as appeareth in <hi>Ephe.</hi> 3.17.<note place="margin">Ephe. 3.17.</note> in these words; <hi>He dwelleth in our hearts by faith.</hi> Now those that are properly and indeede vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Christ, by the spirit and faith, are members of the invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible church, which is properly his spirituall body. And I come now to speake of the vnion of the visible church of Christ, where as I haue formerly said, there must be a distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made, betweene the visible and the invisible church, for the invisible church, is properly and indeede vnited to Christ, but the visible in all the parts thereof are vnited to Christ one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by outward profession. A man that makes outward profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:177007:86"/> of vnion with Christ, may be properly so indeede, but wee cannot certainely know it, but charitably so conceiue, therefore I say that it is the outward profession, and outward preaching of Christ, to be Lord, foundation, and head of the church, that maketh the visible church: and by this externall profession, &amp; ministration of holy things, are we in the church of Great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> vnited to Christ our head, and by these we hold vnion with al the visible parts of the church in the world. If we consider in briefe the whole doctrine of our vnion with Christ, as first, the efficient cause thereof, Gods free election. Secondly, the effectuall vocation vnto the Vnion. Thirdly, the spirituall vnion it selfe by the holy Ghost. Fourthly, the vnion by faith, take it as your church define faith; which is to beleeue the word written is true: or as we define a justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faith, which is to apprehend and apply the promises of grace in Christ by faith: in all these points, both for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and the continuance of this vnion both with Christ our head, and also the members one with another in faith and loue, we hold I say this vnion, as purely by our doctrine, as any Church in the World, and therefore by this marke, we are a true church of Christ.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>We of the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>are the true church of Christ, but ye doe not hold vnion with our church, therefore by this marke of vnion, you are no true church of Christ, but heretickes and schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matickes.</hi>

               <p>We hold vnion with you so farre forth, as you hold v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with Christ. The church is catholike, and Christ is the head thereof. And it being catholike, is not tyed to <hi>Rome.</hi> The good wheat-corne being threshed, doth flie out of the chaffie eare, but not out of the Barne: even so wee flie from your chaffe, and drosse of false doctrine and heresie, but not out of the catholike church; and this shall suffice, to shew that by this marke of vnity, our church, is a true part of the visible catholike church.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Now I will by this marke of vnion proue our church to be the true church; for the Scripture sayth, there shall be one Shepheard and one flocke, and the shepheard is the</hi> Pope, <hi>who is set vp as a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisteriall
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:177007:87"/> head, and the flocke, is the whole Catholike Church. And this church is but one, and is sweetely vnited vnto this head in one faith: therefore the church of</hi> Rome, <hi>is the true catholike church, by this marke of vnity.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>George,</speaker>
               <p>This is my answere, First, that whereas you set vp a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisteriall head, which you doe, you shall never proue it by Scripture.<note place="margin">E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>he. 4.12.</note> For the ministry is dispersed amongst the Pastors, and no in any one head. Secondly, I answere, by this one ministeriall head, your Church did rob Christ of his sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty and honour, because in setting vp this ministeriall head, they steal things from him, proper to him alone, as the priviledge to forgiue sinnes properly, and the power to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne the whole earth, by making of lawes, that shall as truely binde the conscience, as the law of God. Thirdly, for your head, why, there was sometimes 3. at once, as you haue heard, all of them striving for the Popedome; therefore there was no vnity, in the very head of your church. And it is cleare to me, and I would to God in his mercy t'were so to you, and to all private Christians, that your Church hath set vp a false head, and in many parts of their doctrine a false faith, to vnite them vnto this false head. And as for that one pastor that you speake of, it is Christ Iesus, the shepheard of shepheards, who is the onely proper Pastor of the catholike church, both of Iewes and Gentiles.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Philip,</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>You speake falsely, for we haue set vp no false head, nor no false faith, but are truely vnited vnto a true head, and that by a true faith.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>George,</speaker>
               <p>Well well, Seniour <hi>Phillip,</hi> as you and all private men loue your owne salvation, and loue to free your selues from eternall condemnation, be carefull to ground your selues true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by a true faith vpon a true foundation, which is Christ our Saviour; and vnite your selues also by true faith, vnto a true head, which is Christ alone, and none other. But I will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede further to shew you the want of vnion, even in the very heads of your Church. I reade that about the yeare 886. and about the yeare 892. There was greate dissention amongst the Popes, the heads of your Church. I pray harke what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:177007:87"/> I read that Pope <hi>Steven</hi> the sixt abrogated all <hi>Formo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi> his predecessors decrees: and after he was dead and buried, tooke vp his body, cut of 2 fingers of his right hand, and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him againe in lay habite. I read that the following Popes, <hi>Theodorus</hi> the second, <hi>Romanus</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> the 10. confirmed all <hi>Formosus</hi> his Acts. I likewise reade, that after all this, Pope <hi>Sergius</hi> disanulled their Acts: and tooke vp the body of <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosus,</hi> and cast it into the river <hi>Tiber.</hi> Doe you not see, What goodly vnity there was here amongst your heads the Popes? I will shew you the like want of vnity in the whole body of your Church. It is the opinion of your Church, and I thinke it is true; that the whole visible Church is represented by a generall councell. The first Nicen councell allowed Priests marriage, and the Communion in the Lords supper, in both kindes both of bread and wine. But the councells of <hi>Constance</hi> and <hi>Basil,</hi> forbad the laitie the cup. And the councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> forbids both the cup to the laitie, and marriage to the Clergie. I also reade that the third counsell of <hi>Carthage,</hi> that none should be called vniuersall Bishop: But now the councell of <hi>Trent</hi> curseth him, who shall deny the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> to be the head Bishop of all the World. Againe, I reade that the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall councell of <hi>Constantinople</hi> over-threw Images: And I reade that the second councell of <hi>Nice,</hi> decreed them to be worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped: And I read that the councell of <hi>Franckefort</hi> vnder <hi>Charles</hi> the great, determineth it to be Idolatry; and curseth the sayed <hi>Nicen</hi> councell. I reade also that there was a great controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie in Anno. 1476. betwixt the <hi>Franciscans</hi> and <hi>Dominican</hi> Fryers, touching the conception of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> whither she were conceived in sin or no: the <hi>Dominicans</hi> held she was; the <hi>Franciscans</hi> the contrary: But Pope <hi>Zistus</hi> the 4. Ioyning with the <hi>Franciscans,</hi> 4. of the other were condemned &amp; burnt at <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alph. de Castro.</hi> Chap. 6. holdes the Pope Inferiour to the councell, the opinion of the <hi>Iesuites &amp;c.</hi> This day is he aboue the councell. I reade that about the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> they haue a world of differences amongst themselues; as whether Christ did consecrate when hee blessed the bread and the wine, or
<pb facs="tcp:177007:88"/> when hee said this is my body. Secondly, whether so much bread as is taken onely, be consecrated? Thirdly, whether the substance of the bread be turned to nothing, or changed into the substance of Christ? whether there be a bodily motion in the Sacrament. Whether the body of Christ, in the Sacrament can be touched? how the accidents in the sacramēts are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a subiect? whether the accidents can be broken, whether they can nourish? whether the water mingled with the wine, be turned into Christs bloud? whence come wormes in the host? Thus you see what diuisions &amp; dissentions there are, amongst you, both in your Popes councells, and severall orders of Priests. Is this the vnity you bragg of? Sure your vnity may be rather called a Conspiracy against Christ, then a vnity vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him. <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilate</hi> were made freindes, against Christ should be crucified; and they joyned in the execution of him: So all of you, whatsoever your dissentions and discordes bee amongst your selues, even in matters of faith, yet in this one maine Article of your faith; that the Pope is head, and hath a supremacy over the whole Church of God; Herein you must needs concurre and agree, though in my poore Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the most weakly maintained, of all other points con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverced betweene you and vs. For this point, (as I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber) <hi>Bellarmine</hi> saith is the head of faith: and for the denyall of this, all must lose their dearest blood, though they main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Christ to be the supreame head never so purely: Iewes shall liue in their bosome, even in <hi>Rome,</hi> vnder the Popes nose, though they vtterly deny Christ: this is a fearefull case, and this is a wicked vnion.</p>

                  <hi>I am contented, and therefore as you haue begunne the other markes at your Church, so beginne this: and in this marke, you shall never be able to proue your Church, a Church of Christ.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>George,</speaker>
               <p>Yes surely but I can, by the helpe of God, proue it to be
<pb facs="tcp:177007:88"/> a most holy Church, as holy a part of the visible Church mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litant, as is any visible part in the Christian world.</p>

                  <hi>I never saw, nor reasoned with so Impotent a man: You will proue any thing for the maintaining of your hereticall church; if you can; why doe you not see, are you blinde, that your people both magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates and ministers, and all soules of subiects, be most vilde in vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlynes, and doe expresse it in the wickednes of their liues?</hi>

               <speaker>George,</speaker>
               <p>Surely I confesse with griefe of heart, that the generall multitude of our people, are grievously polluted with feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full sinnes of many kindes. But what if it might be sayd of vs, as the Prophet <hi>Amos</hi> sayd of the Governors of <hi>Samaria?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Amos 4.1.</note>
                  <hi>You oppresse the poore, and destroy the needy.</hi> And also, what if it might be sayd, of our Governors, as the Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> sayd? <hi>Woe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them that decree wicked decrees, and write greevious things: To keepe backe the poore from Iudgement; and to take away the Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the poore of my people, that Widowes may be their prey:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Esa. 10.1.2 Zeph 3.4.</note>
                  <hi>and that they may spoyle the Father-lesse. Esay.</hi> 10.1.2. And what if it might be sayd of our Ministers and Prophets, that they are light and wicked persons, and that they haue polluted the Sanctuary? And what if the Lord should call the insensible Creatures, <hi>the heavens and the earth,</hi> as he doth by the Prophet <hi>Esaiah,</hi> to witnesse against vs for our rebellion In these words? <hi>heare O Heavens and hearken O Earth, for the Lord hath said: I haue nourished Children, and brought them vp,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Esa. 1.2.</note>
                  <hi>and they haue rebelled against me.</hi> Yet wee may be a pure Church visible for all that: Because wee maintaine the pure faith and Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine.</p>

               <speaker>George,</speaker>
               <p>Surely I must be faine to catechise you in this, as I haue in the rest of our discourse. You may see how jgnorantly you haue beene bred in your Religion: that you must be catechis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the markes of your owne Church. They tell you that Succession, Vnity, Sanctitie and Holines and others, are marks of the visible Church: But without succession of faith and doctrine, and vnity in faith and doctrine; and if the visible Church be not made holy by the true faith and doctrine, these
<pb facs="tcp:177007:89"/> markes are but deceitfull, and may guide you to the Church; whose false wicked doctrine, will teach you rather the way to hell and everlasting destruction; then to heaven to enjoy eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall happynes and blisse.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Philip,</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Well, I pray proceede, and make no long preambles; how is the visible Church pure and holy?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>George,</speaker>
               <p>I am desirous to edifye you, and resolue you in all things, to the power and vnderstanding, God in his mercy hath given me, and therefore I am sure, that the visible Church is pure and holy in two or three respects. I should haue put this in minde, still that you keepe a distinction betweene the Invisible and the visible Church. For the Invisible Church I haue told you, is properly and indeede, the spirituall and mys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall body of Christ: and I haue told you how that that body is perfectly holy, pure and righteous, in the sight of God by Iustification: And in part holy by Sanctification in this life. Now I desire if it were possible, to speake to the capacitie of the simplest amongst you, that you might not be deceived in the purity, holines, and sanctitie of the Church: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now I come to the holines of the visible Church. And I say as before, it is called holy in two or three respects. Now as I take it, the visible Church is holy; and so called first, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of some small remnant that be in it, that are perfectly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before God by Iustification; and in part holy by sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I will shew you a prety fitt Similitude, and it is this. Threshers vse when they haue threshed, to put the corne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it be fanned on a heape, and this heape is called corne, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the greatest part be chaffe: Even so the congregation of the visible Church, is called holy, in respect of the small number of holy ones in it: even as the heape is called corne, though most of it be chaffe. The denomination of the word Holy, is of the better part, and not of the greater: for the most are Hipocrites and prophaine Dissemblers. This in my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is clearely proved by the Prophet <hi>Esaiah:</hi> The Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Israell</hi> were visible Churches; of them the Prophet saith: Though the number of the Children of Israell be as the sands of the sea; <hi>yet shall but a remnant be saved.</hi> Our
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:177007:89"/> Saviour calleth his, <hi>but a little flocke:</hi> And he saith, <hi>there be but fewe that walke in the narrow way to heaven.</hi> So that the Church visible, is called holy in respect of the small remnant of holy ones, which are properly misticall members of Christ: which doe lye hid in the visible Church, from the eyes of men, yet seene to the eyes of God. And thus you see the first reason why the visible Church is called holy.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Philip,</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Well, seeing you haue vndertaken to catechise me, let me know a second reason of it?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>George,</speaker>
               <p>A second reason why the visible Church is called holy, Is, because God hath committed vnto her, his holy ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; the Word and Sacraments. And for this cause she is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by Saint <hi>Paul, the pillar and ground of truth.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Tim. 3.15</note> Not that shee should add vnto truth, any thing that is devised by her selfe: but that she should vphold the truth, herein the world against the Devill and wicked men, who labour to pull downe the truth by their lying and deceitfull Doctrines. A strong pillar in a house doth as you know, beare vp the house and support it from falling in windy stormes and tempestous wether: Even so, doth the visible Church the truth of God, against the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy stormes of hereticall Doctrine: and so against the tempesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous lightenings, fiery persecutions by wicked enemies of the truth, except she bee negligent of her duty. A third reason why the visible Church of God is called holy, is, because she spreadeth abroad the holy truth to the World: And this she doth by two wayes; First, by reading it to the world, and by this she testifyeth as a witnesse, that it is the truth of God. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, she speaketh Gods word by explication: and thus she delivereth the true sence of the word of truth, to the better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming of the Iudgement of the people. And thus also by application, she either converteth to salvation, or else convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth the consciences of men to their condemnation. The fourth reason, why the visible Church is called holy; is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall profession of holynes, and that according to the rule of the holy Word of truth, revealed in the scriptures to the Church.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Philip,</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now let me see, whether the Church of great Brittaine may be
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:177007:90"/> called holy by these reasons?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>George,</speaker>
               <p>For the first reason, that the visible Church is called holy, for the small number of those, that bee truely holy in it; I am assuredly perswaded, that the Lord affecting so his owne or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, which are the preaching of the Word, and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of his Sacraments, which haue bin purely performed, by this our Church of great <hi>Brittaine</hi> this many yeares, since our happy time of reformation; that hee hath, and daily doth conferre grace in the hearts of such, as he hath ordained to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: and that many multitudes, though not the greatest; which haue receiued the first fruites of their Inheritance; and are now translated from hence, having all teares wiped from their eyes, are now in rest in their soules, at the right hand of God, with Christ Iesus their head in glory. I am also perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, so long as God in mercy to this our Nation, shall hold o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the booke of the Gospell of his deare Sonne; that it may be preached, read, and taught, that many more, from time to time, will be brought to faith and repentance, &amp; consequently to eternall happines and blisse of soule &amp; body for ever; which God in mercy grant vnto vs. And thus our Church is holy by the first reason.</p>
               <p>Now I come to the second reason, why the visible Church is called holy, which is because God hath intrusted her, and committed vnto her keeping, his holy ordinances: And for this cause, she is called the pillar &amp; ground of truth. Now I say, by this reason also, is this our Nationall and particular church of great <hi>Brittaine</hi> most excellently holy. I beseech you to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider it, for she hath, and doth faithfully discharge the trust re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed in her: For she suffereth it not to bee corrupted, by false additions, neither doth she suffer it to be diminished by repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling any statute, or law of Gods holy Scriptures, which hee hath committed vnto her: but faithfully keepeth it perfect, pure, holy, and entire, as it is in it selfe, delivered vnto her by God himselfe. She also preserueth it by Gods assistance, from wicked enemies, and opposers that labour to invade her, and vtterly to expulse the Gospell of peace from this Kingdome. As for example, In 1588. the Lord from heaven, made the
<pb facs="tcp:177007:90"/> Elements of wind and water to fight for her, to the over-throw of your great Navie, and also the Lord did as it were by Myra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle quench the violence of fire, intended by our treacherous domestick bosome enemies, in their Gun-powder plot. And God in mercy hath confounded the manifold other devises, which the enemies of our Church and Gods truth, enviously haue plodded against vs: She is a shelter to strangers of other Nations, who doe professe the same word of truth with vs, and being exiled, flee the greevous persecutions of your Church, or of the enemies of the truth.</p>
               <p>For the third reason, that the visible Church is called holy, by spreading it to the world, first, by reading: and thus our Church of Great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> doth shew her selfe to be a holy and faithfull visible Church. In that she readeth the holy Scripture, not in a strange and vnknowne tongue, for then shee should be a Barbarian to her children but in her owne tongue faithfully translated, whereby her children may by it learne to try all things, and to keepe that which is good, and that they might search the Scriptures; <hi>for in them they thinke to haue eternall life, for they doe testifie of Christ:</hi> and that <hi>this word of God, should dwell plenteously in her children,</hi> and that by it, <hi>they should learne to speake graciously:</hi> and thus you see, she doth teach her children like a good Christian mother, the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of <hi>Canaan</hi> the holy tongue. Thus you see our Church is no concealer of the word and scriptures of God, as yours of <hi>Rome</hi> is: but like a faithfull pillar of truth, spreadeth it to her Children, by reading it vnto them, &amp; suffering them to learne the language of the Scriptures, by reading it themselues. Oh the wonderfull and vnspeakable benefit, that commeth to the people of God, by this liberty of reading the Scriptures! for this me thinkes, you should affect vnion with vs. And lastly, by explication, doth our church shew her selfe to be holy, in that she doth deliver a true sence &amp; construction of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to her children, by Divinity-Lectures, and Sermons, and by this doth shee convince her adversaries; that by their Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular learning doe oppose the truth of God revealed in the Scriptures: as is evident by the bookes of controversies, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb facs="tcp:177007:91"/> by our learned King, and our learned Pastors against your Church: &amp; also she sheweth her selfe to be holy by application, by vsing the keyes of Gods kingdome faithfully. And this she doth ministerially, by denouncing the terrors, threats, and curses of the law, against all wicked and impenitent sinners, exposing them to the infinite Iudgement of Gods wrath, till they repent and beleeue: And thus she shuts the kingdome of heaven. Againe, she ministerially sets open the kingdome of heaven to all beleeving penitents;: by applying the blessed promises of grace in the name of Christ, whereby they bee comforted in their deepest distresse of conscence for their sins: And like a holy and loving mother, by her holy ministry, doth share out in holy wisedome, the portion due to every vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Church of hers. Those that are weake, and but Babes; she giues them the sincere milke of the word of God, that they may growe thereby. And those that are able to beare it, shee giveth stronger meate: For the word of God which she doth administer, is fit for both: her Pastors are wise and able to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister comfort to them which are weary. Shee in example of Christ her head, by her ministry, doth not quench the smoak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing flax, nor breake the brused reed. But cherisheth the weake, and confirmeth the strong: and thus I haue shewed you the holines of our Church by the third reason, which is by expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. And now I come to the fourth and last reason of the holines of the visible Church, and that is her externall and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profession.</p>

               <p>Truely Seniour <hi>Philip</hi> I confesse, as before with greife, that the greater number of our people of all sorts in this Iland, and Church, are vile, and prophane; and I doe thinke, that were it not for the good lawes of our Kingdome, which doe constraine and compell them, to make outward profession, they would many of them make none at all. Their outward carriage in al manner of wickednes, their liues doth apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shew it so. But what of this, do you thinke that the covenant of God, is broken with the whole? Our Kings and Queenes,
<pb facs="tcp:177007:91"/> together with our Auncients and fore-fathers, both of the L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> make a covenant most blessedly with God, to purge the land &amp; kingdom of your popish superstition and jdolatry. In King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. his dayes it was begunne: In King <hi>Edwards</hi> the reformation was much more further perfected: In Queene <hi>Elizabeths,</hi> it still encreased: and in our late most learned King <hi>Iames</hi> his time, &amp; now still most happily continued. This they haue done in example of the good Kings of <hi>Iudea,</hi> as <hi>Ezekiah</hi> and <hi>Iosiah,</hi> and others. And according to this first reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, haue we made a profession, and in this outward profession blessed be God, we still keepe covenant with God; which I beseech our Almightie, and eternall most blessed God, for his blessed sonns sake Iesus Christ our Lord, our Pastors may so doe to the end of the world.</p>
               <p>But now to come to our professors, I grant that the greater number of the professors of our Religion, may be but form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all; &amp; that they doe professe for wrong endes and by-respects, as to avoyde the Penalties of our civill Lawes, and our Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall censures. And againe, for the prayses of men, for that they would bee counted good Church-men: And to avoyde the scandall of prophanes, and because they thinke it safest to doe as most doe: and many doe make the out-ward profession of Gods truth, to be a meanes, the better to bring to passe their projects of deceipts; and too many doe make their out-ward profession as figg-leaues to cover their inward hipocrysie. The established visible churches, were never without such bad pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors: For where God hath his Church, there the Devill will haue his Chappell: If not by heresie, yet he will haue it set vp by deceiptfull hipocrysie. Thus farre of our worst professors, and now to our better. These be those that are out-wardly better reformed: First, a man may discerne them by their company, for they will shunne the company of such as are in their liues prophane and vnreformed, and wil associate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues with such as are vertuous and godly. They avoyde the first, for feare of defilement by tentation to evill: and they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline vnto the other, because they would haue their spirits
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:177007:92"/> quickened vnto good. And for their habit in apparell, it is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest, nor greedily taking vp every vaine new fashion; as is the manner of our vainest and prophanest professors, and of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of your gallantest <hi>Romane Catholikes.</hi> Neither is their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrell costly aboue their rankes and callings, but rather vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; avoyding superfluities, both in apparell, diet, and other ordinary expences, whereby they may the better enable them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues for pious, godly, and charitable expences, as God by his providence, shall call for it at their hands. Their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour is gratious, vertue is seene in their very Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enance, their speech is not scurrilous and Wanton, but for the most part gratious vnto edification allwayes: the holy tongue and language of <hi>Canaan</hi> is frequent amongst them. All mens tongues by nature, are set on fire of hell; but Gods grace hath so prevailed with them, as to quench their tongues, with the waters of vertue: In a word, we haue in our Church, such professors, as doe avoyde all appearance of evill; and which doe keepe them-selues vnspotted of the world, and without the reach of iust exception of any. They are godly, giving attendance at the dore-posts of Gods house, to heare his Word, that they might learne from Gods Word, rules to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect them in the carriages of their liues. And they there, in a holy joynt-communion, with the congregation, offer vp their praises and prayers, in the name of our blessed Mediatour Christ, for whose sake, they and their sacrifices, are accepted of God, being offered in faith. And for the sacraments, which be Instruments and signes, and seales of salvation, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scionably frequent them often: and this their holy and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous life, is not according to the lawes or rules of humane In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, but according to the rules and lawes of God, revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the Scriptures. Now I say, though many may in our Church make glorious shewes to the World, of sincerity in their profession, and yet be deceitfull hypocrites: yet I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded assuredly, that we haue multitudes that are true <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaniels, Israelites,</hi> in whose hearts (as they are sanctified) is no guile: whose outward profession doth proceede from pure hearts, good consciences, and faith vnfained; and in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
<pb facs="tcp:177007:92"/> of their liues, haue a due respect vnto all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of God, walking honestly in all things, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the garments spotted by the flesh. And thus I haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved our Church of great Brittaine, to bee a true and holy church, by your mark of holines. Nwo let vs try yours by it also.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Now let me shew you the proofe of our Church by this marke of holines, to be a true Church: As first there be holy men admirable for holines. Secondly, there is a holy sevice. Thirdly, holy Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. Fourthly, holy sacrifice, holy sacraments, and lastly, holy dayes.</hi>

               <speaker>George,</speaker>
               <p>Now let me shew you how holy your Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is, I will beginne at the head and fountaine thereof your <hi>Popes,</hi> for so you take them to bee: And looke what the head and fountaine is, such must needes be the body, and streames that flowe from such head and fountaine. I will beginne with Pope <hi>Marcellinus,</hi> of whom I reade that he sacrificed to the Idols of the <hi>Painims.</hi> I reade that Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the 6. poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned <hi>Gemes</hi> the great Turkes brother, committed to his cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stody. I reade that one Pope <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> hired one to kill the <hi>Emperour.</hi> I reade that Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> the 13. committed Incest with his two sisters: and I reade that he was wounded in adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery. I reade that Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the sixt, lay with his owne Daughter. I reade that Pope <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> was a Sorcerer. I read that Pope <hi>Silvester</hi> the second, gaue himselfe to the Devill, to be Pope. I read that many others were <hi>Magitians,</hi> as <hi>Iohn</hi> the 21. and <hi>Benedict</hi> the 9. &amp;c. Againe, I read that Pope <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> the 6. cut off the the hands and feete of one <hi>Mencinellus,</hi> because he wrote against his filthines. I reade that Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> the 13. cut off the hands and noses of divers <hi>Cardinalls.</hi> I read that Pope <hi>Sergius</hi> the 3. kept another mans wife, her name was <hi>Marozia,</hi> wife to one <hi>Guido.</hi> I read that his Bastard came to the <hi>Popedome,</hi> his name was Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> the 11. or 12. I read that Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> the 4. graunted liberty to the whole family of the <hi>Cardinall</hi> of Saint <hi>Luce</hi> in the three hoat moneths, <hi>Iune, Iuly,</hi> and <hi>August,</hi> to vse <hi>Sodomy:</hi> At the foote of the licence was written, be it, as it is requested. I read that every common Harlot in <hi>Rome,</hi> paid a fee to Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> the 4. Thus, that whereas you condemne our Churches of vnholines, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:177007:93"/> it could not be in your opinion by this marke a Church of Christ. What should one thinke of your Church, that hath such vngodly a head and fountaine? Now seeing there is such wickednes in the head of your Church, I will shew you the wicked errors of some of your Popes. First <hi>Liberius</hi> an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, secondly <hi>Anastatius</hi> the second <hi>Anastasian,</hi> thirdly <hi>Honori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> a Monothelit, condemned by the <hi>Roman</hi> Councell vnder <hi>Adrian,</hi> fourthly <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> threw the Sacrament into the fire, sixtly <hi>Iohn</hi> the 22. derided the Gospell held the soules to be mortall, and was therefore by the Councell of <hi>Constance</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Devill incarnat, sixtly <hi>Leo</hi> the 10. to Cardinall <hi>Beambus,</hi> calleth the story of Christ a fable, seuenthly, <hi>Iohn</hi> the 13. cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Devill to helpe him at Dice, and dranke to him. Now I will shew you, what I reade of the filthines, of the principall part of the body. I reade that one <hi>Gallus Senonensis,</hi> wrote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 400. yeares agoe, that Sathan was let loose at <hi>Rome,</hi> to destroy the Church. I read that Thomas <hi>Becket</hi> a <hi>Romish</hi> Saint, acknowledged the common proverbe to be true, that there is no right at <hi>Rome.</hi> I reade that the Bishop of worcester a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist told <hi>Philpot,</hi> that he thought the wickednes he saw in <hi>Rome,</hi> made him an Heretick. If the head-Pastor, and head-City of your religion, be thus defiled with so wicked behaviour, what is the whole body of your professors?</p>

               <p>As for my errors, I will renounce them, if you can shew me them: But I suppose, you can shew me no error heerein.

But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to the seeming holines of your Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:177007:93"/> you would proue it to be a pure and true Church, for your holy service. I marvell what your Church meaneth to haue it in Latin, and not in the Vulgar tongues; whereby the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple might acquaint themselues with the holines thereof? But Sathan being an old Polititian, hath prevailed with your Church; to hide your sevice in an vnknowne tongue from the people, that they should not spie out the blasphemous fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thines of your service. Let me shew you a little in part, your vnholy and corrupt service. God in the Prophet <hi>Esaiah</hi> saith: <hi>He will not giue his honour to any other.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Esa 48.21.</note> And this is a great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to God, to flee vnto him onely by prayer: there is neither Commandement nor promise in the scripture, that if wee doe pray vnto Saints, we shall be heard: vpon which two, every lawfull prayer must bee built. I meane, vpon a Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and promise, what saith Saint <hi>Iames?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iam. 1.5.</note>
                  <hi>If any man lacke Wisedome, let him aske it of God, and it shalbe given him.</hi> And what saith Saint <hi>Paul?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 10.13</note>
                  <hi>Whosoever shall call vpon the name of the Lord, shalbe saved.</hi> And who is the Mediator, by whom we must pray? Is it not Christ alone, and no other. For what say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the scripture? There is one Mediator betweene God and man, the man Christ Iesus. And therefore what saith our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour? <hi>What soever you aske my Father in my name, he will giue it you.</hi> Againe, what saith our Saviour? <hi>Come vnto me, all yee that are weary, and heavie laden, and I will ease you.</hi> Vpon the Saints dayes in your Church, in their prayers, still these words come in: That by their merits, wee may haue profit; and by their requests, we may be delivered. Thus they derogate from the mercy of God, and the gloryous merits of Christ, as if his were not sufficient. This one place of <hi>Esay,</hi> me thinkes should convince their prayers to the Saints departed, if they would acknowledge it; The words are, <hi>doubtlesse thou art our father, though</hi> Abraham, <hi>be ignorant of vs, and</hi> Israell <hi>know vs not.</hi> If <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> the father of the faithfull, be ignorant of vs; so is all the rest of his Saints: therefore in vaine to pray vnto them. And for your daily sacrifice of the Masse, it is a blasphemous Idole; <hi>for Christ offered himselfe, a most perfect sacrifice:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb 9.15. Heb. 10 20.</note>
                  <hi>With which God was well pleased. And this he did but once for all.</hi> You
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:177007:94"/> adore a peece of bread, when it is carried in procession, for though it were true that the bread in the Sacrament, were tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into the body of Christ: yet the Sacrament being ended, it must needs returne to the former nature. What a fond thing is it to make prayers for the dead, because there is no certainty of their estate? And they salute the Crosse saying, all haile O Crosse, our onely hope &amp;c. Increase righteousnesse to the godly, and giue pardon to the guilty. And you pray the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <hi>Mary,</hi> to pray the Father, charge thy Sonne, commaund by the right of a mother: they say that Saint <hi>Francis,</hi> could saue all that should liue after him, to the end of the World, through his merits, from everlasting death. Looke 1. <hi>Timo:</hi> 2.5. and that place proveth that there is <hi>but one Mediator, as there is but one God.</hi> I reade that the forme of the absolution, to penitentiares runneth thus, the passion of Christ, and the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the blessed Virgin, of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> and Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and of other Hee, and Shee Saints, be vnto thee for remission of sins. What vngodly, and vnchristian divinity is this? I reade that whosoever readeth the Cannon of the Masse, shall there see, a world of idle &amp; ridiculous ceremonies. I read that they say in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they haue the forme of the Masse, by the traditions of the Apostles. But the truth is, that it was now a peece, and then a peece patched vp by their owne Popes. As first, <hi>Sixtus</hi> the second brought in the <hi>Sanctus: Innocentius</hi> first, brought in the Pax: and <hi>Leo,</hi> the 1. added this clause: a holy Sacrifice, and vnbloudy Host. <hi>Gelasius,</hi> brought in the Prefaces, and Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects, and Gradualls. <hi>Simmachus,</hi> the <hi>gloria in Excelsis: Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petus</hi> 1. Processions, <hi>Pelagius,</hi> 2. the 9. Prefaces before the Cannon. <hi>Sergius</hi> 1. brought in <hi>Agnus dei. Gregory</hi> 1. confesseth, that one <hi>Scholasticus</hi> made most part of the Cannon. Thus you may perceiue that there is not written in the fore-head and outward profession of your Head Pastors, and Church <hi>Holines vnto the Lord.</hi> But rather Idolatrous superstition, and vngodlines to the Prince of darknesse, and to Antichrist. For these things that I haue recited, being in your publique ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice booke, cannot be proved by the word of God, which is the Cannon &amp; rule of holines, by which the visible church of God, should direct her selfe.</p>

                  <hi>It is nothing yet you haue sayd; for the Church is holy by her faith, for Christ hath promised, that her faith shall not faile: and she hath the spirit to lead her into all truth, and Christ prayed that</hi> Peters <hi>faith should not faile. Therefore the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in faith, for that was</hi> Peters <hi>Bishopricke, and the promise belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>and the posterity thereof after him, to the end of the world.</hi>

               <p>Faine you would proue your Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> a true Chuch by this marke of holines, and her holines by her faith: But alas you cannot. Christs promise indeede is certaine, and doth not faile any of the elect; for their faith shall never faile, nor the Gates of hell shall never prevaile against it. This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise was made to <hi>Peter;</hi> but you must consider that it was made to him, as he was one of the elect of God: and a faithful Disciple of his Lord and Master, and the effect of it was, that his faith in that his Lord and Master Iesus Christ, should ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver vtterly faile, how-soever he might slip and fall. And hee prayed for <hi>Peter,</hi> as he prayed for every faithfull man, whose faith doth not faile, but is the hand and instrument of their salvation. Thus you may see, what errors and absurdities your Church doth runne into, by not holding a distinction, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene men as they are of the visible, and as they are of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible Church. And for as much as your Church doth bragg, as other heretickes doe, of the promise of the spirit: let me tell you that the spirit, is alwayes joyned with the Word; for these are inseparable. Marke what the Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> saith of the new covenant, in these words: <hi>And I will make this my covenant with them saith the Lord, my spirit that is vpon thee, and my words which I haue put in thy mouth: shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seede, nor out of the mouth of the seede of thy seede, saith the Lord: from hence forth even for ever.</hi> The word and spirit cannot bee disioyned, without fearefull sacriledge: therefore our Saviour Christ saith, <hi>when the comforter is come,</hi> meaning the spirit of truth, <hi>he shall leade you into all truth: and he shall bring all things to your remembrance which I haue told you.</hi> And he saith to the Apostles, in Saint <hi>Mathew</hi> by comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement,
<pb facs="tcp:177007:95"/>
                  <hi>teaching them to obserue all things,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iath. 28.20.</note>
                  <hi>whatsoever I haue commaunded you.</hi> And to this, hee promises his presence, <hi>loe I am with you alway to the end of the world.</hi> So that you see that the spirit doth leade the Church into the truth of Christ, and bringeth it to their remembrance; and the Apostles must teach nothing, but that which Christ commaunded them. And therefore the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth wickedly, to teach for doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, any thing which cannot be proved by the Word of Christ: and therefore by this marke of holines, she is no true holy Church of Christ; because severall Articles of her faith, haue no ground in the scriptures, which is the holy Word of faith.</p>

               <p>Yea that I can, first she can never proue it lawfull for the word and scriptures of God, and the publike worship and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Church, to bee in an vnknowne tongue: but wee can proue the scriptures condemne it. Secondly, you cannot proue that the Pope and Church, can take away from the Lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, the Cup and Sacrament of the body and bloud of Christ. Thirdly, they cannot proue their religious worship of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. Fourthly, they cannot proue, that <hi>Peter</hi> was Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that <hi>Linus, Cletus</hi> and <hi>Clement</hi> were his successors there. These points there is not so much as a seeming shew in scripture to proue them: many other Articles of their faith, they endevour to proue by scripture, which are controverted betweene them and vs, but the cannot. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> proclaimes to the World, that shee is the pillar and ground of truth: I would to God, she were as she professeth her selfe to be: Then would she vphold the truth, but she rather vphold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and spreadeth her owne deceitfull Doctrine, then the truth of God. Oh that she were as <hi>Paul</hi> was, <hi>pure from the bloud of all men:</hi> then she should doe as <hi>Paul</hi> did; <hi>keepe nothing backe, but shew the whole Councell of God to the people.</hi>

Without holines it is imposible to see God, as the scripture saith. None must come nigh vnto God that is not holy: none shall possesse the eternall habitation of holines in the heavens, but those that haue the beginnings of holines heere on earth: therefore the Lord hath set downe such rules and lawes of holines in the holy scriptures, as will make men holy in his sight; if they in their course of life, take heede there-vnto. Now the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> enjoynes to be observed by her Children, such lawes and things as the scriptures never sanctified nor made holy for his religious service.

               <p>It is to little purpose, to be large in other markes; seeing without soundnes of Doctrine, all your markes, doe not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover a true pure Church without it: and therefore for other markes, I will now but as it were touch them. And as for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie, one of your markes I haue shewed already: that ours, is as ancient as yours, if not before it in antiquity, but for foundnes of doctrine; it is before it in antiquity as the ancient recordes of the scriptures doe testifye, and I haue proved vnto you.</p>
               <p>And as I haue shewed vnto you, that faith and doctrine is essentiall to the visible Church, for it is the forme and life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blood of the Church; so let mee (as I thinke) explaine it to you by a fit similitude. A man of a Noble family in our king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, very anciently descended, and truely honourable by descent in blood; If hee wickedly commite treachery against
<pb facs="tcp:177007:96"/> our King and his royall issue, or against the state; Is not his blood of honour, both for himselfe, and his posterity tainted, and quite extinguished by his great disloyaltie? Even by the lawes of our kingdome, he cannot now in any case pleade his prerogatiues of honour; neither can his issue, vnlesse the King restore them. Let vs apply this similitude; our Church whilst it remained with your Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and held com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with her, was a long time polluted in her bloud: The forme, faith, and life of her, was so corrupted by consen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the disloyall treachery against God, and his Sonne Christ and all his Children; that had not our most gracious God, restored her to her ancient Nobilitie and honour, by making her through his grace, ashamed of her Idolatry and superstition, and false-worship, which she treacherously practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iere 6 15.</note> and also caused her to stand in the wayes, as the Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> exhorted the Iewes to <hi>aske af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the old and ancient wayes of the Lord, which is the good way,</hi> from which with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> shee had a long time gone astray, she had still remained Ignoble and dishonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. It had beene vaine, and to no purpose, to pleade her an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Nobility of an ancient Church, considering whilst shee remained with you, shee was polluted in her life-bloud, by treacherous Idolatry and superstition: but now,<note place="margin">Ier. 6.16.</note> by Gods free mercy and favour, she hath obeyed his voyce and command by the ministry of the Prophet <hi>Ieremy. For shee hath stood in the wayes, and asked for the old way, which is the good way,</hi> and found it: and she teacheth her Children to walke therein, that they might finde rest vnto their soules. So that the ancient Church of God now liveth in her, and all other parts of the visible Church, in whom the Lord hath restored the pure life of faith and doctrine: so that now wee may iustly stand vpon our No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and honourable antiquity, as a prorogatiue which cannot iustly be gainsayed.</p>
               <p>And now for the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> we confesse that she was an ancient, honourable, and Noble Church of Christ; but her case is altred, for she hath lost the best part of her Nobility, and antiquity, and that by meere treachery both against Christ
<pb facs="tcp:177007:97"/> and his Church: her ancient Noble-bloud of found doctrine, is stained with novelty and heresie many wayes, as hath beene abundantly proved vnto her by many of our learned Divines. But as the Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> said of the Iewes Church; <hi>they were not ashamed:</hi> So may we say of <hi>Rome,</hi> that she is not ashamed of her abominations,<note place="margin">Iere. 6.15.16.</note> although she hath beene never so lovingly exhorted by the Lord; and that by the ministry of his servants in these latter times. The old and ancient wayes of the Lord, which is the good way, is contemned, her owne wayes newly devised by her selfe imbraced, and of her Children obeyed: And therefore I must needs conclude, that she is yet defiled in her bloud, by hereticall novelty; and therefore in vaine for her to plead for her proofe to bee a true Church by her marke of antiquity.</p>
               <p>And for your marke of multitude, it is strange it should bee counted a marke of a visible Church; whereas it is rather a marke of the wicked routes of the Devill: For so the Heathens might haue opposed sometime against the Church and said, we haue all Nations but one, and in that one Nation all fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies against one or two:<note place="margin">Gene. 6.</note> as in the time of <hi>Noe,</hi> they that are called men of renowne, &amp; intituled the sonnes of God, mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both <hi>Noe,</hi> and his Religion.

               <p>
                  <hi>Haue you any more to say of the visible Church?</hi>
               </p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>George,</speaker>
               <p>Surely I haue done at this time, what I meant to say of the visible Church; and I pray God it may profit you and other poore simple seduced soules, who are ignorant what the church is, and whereof it doth consist. It now remaineth that we should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre of the faith of the visible church, but I told you at the first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of our conferēce, that the discourse cōcerning the faith of the visible church would be some-what large: and sure Seig: <hi>Philip,</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:177007:98"/> I doe not know whether I shall liue to haue conferrence with you about it: for the faith of the church is, as health &amp; life to the body; and they that should confer with you about it, had need to be very judicious to edifie you in it. I haue hitherto but a little touched the life of the visible church, and I doe desire with my heart, that some wise judicious private Christian, would privately confer with you about the health &amp; life of the visible church; we in our conference of the visible church, haue but as it were surveyed the outward parts of the church. That which followeth to be treated of, is the very anatomizing of the visible church, by searching into the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and life of the visible church: &amp; he that should confer with you, had neede to be well read in the Doctrine of the pure Orthodoxall church, and also of the Doctrine of those two parts of the visible Church, which we haue hitherto treated of, I meane the church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Church of great <hi>Brittain,</hi> he had neede to be no No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in the singular Art of divine <hi>Theologie,</hi> that he might be wise, to discover the diseases and sicknesses of both these two parts of the Church, and be wise also to shew their care in this: I confesse that my Iudgement is too weake. I want both Arts and Learning, and the gift of tongues: but yet I could finde in my heart, to draw out a plot and referre the building to them that are wiser, if any judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous private Christian of our religion will vnder-take it.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Come on then I pray you, let me see your plot, and I will shew you how I like it.</hi>

               <speaker>George,</speaker>
               <p>I haue in our conference of the visible Church, shewed that Christ Iesus being perfect man, is every where in the scripture cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led our Lord, and that he is the Lord, both of heaven &amp; earth, and that it is essentiall to the visible church, so to confesse and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him. Now in this, I would aske your Iudgement, whether that part of the visible, church which doe by their Doctrine most purely preach to the world, the <hi>Soveraignty</hi> of his Lord ship, and do giue vnto him, all his dignities and prerogatiues royall, both in heaven and earth: be the safest Church for a private man to joyne with, and submit himselfe vnto for the guide of his soule and body vnto everlasting life?</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>I answer, it is the safest to submit vnto, and that is the Church of</hi> Rome.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Geo.</speaker>
               <p>Again, I aske your Iudgement, whether the Church be the safest
<pb facs="tcp:177007:99"/> to joyne with, that doth most purely preach faith in his name?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Philip,</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>I say it is the safest, and that also the Church of</hi> Rome.</p>

               <p>Againe, I aske you whereas <hi>Paul</hi> saith, there is one Lord, one Faith, one Baptisme. Which baptisme is the ministeriall Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which the visible Church doth vse to initiate and knit men vnto Christ, and his misticall body: whether that Church which teacheth most purely, the Doctrine of sacramentall vnion with Christ by baptisme be your safest course to joyne with?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Philip,</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>I say it is the safest, and that also is the Church of</hi> Rome.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Geo.</speaker>
               <p>I will aske you three questions of another sort, the first is, that whereas all things must be done to the glory of God; whether the Church be the safest to joyne with, &amp; submit vnto, that doth most glorifie God by her doctrine?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Philip,</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>I say it is the safest, which is the Church of</hi> Rome.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Geo.</speaker>
               <p>The 2. question of this sort, is that, whereas that none but those which are humble, are fitt for grace; therefore is not that Church the safest to submitte vnto, that doth by her doctrine, throw men down in the sight of their misery, by sin, both originall, &amp; actual?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Philip,</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>I say it is the safest, which is the Church of</hi> Rome.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>George,</speaker>
               <p>A third question of the second sort, whether the church, when a sinfull man is humbled in the sight of his misery by sinne, is the safest to joyne with, that by her Doctrine doth ministerially best restore, and lift him vp to a state of grace?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Philip,</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>This also is the safest, and that is the Church of</hi> Rome.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>George,</speaker>
               <p>There are foure questions more to aske you, but I will include them all in one: There are foure grounds of religion, as first, the Creede, the second, the Lords prayer, the third, the Sacraments, the fourth and last the ten Commandements. And is that the safest Church that te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cheth these foure grounds most purely?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Philip,</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Yes no question, and that is also the Church of</hi> Rome.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>George,</speaker>
               <p>These points I thought good, to lay as a ground for a further dispute, concerning the faith and life of a Church visible, the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of these points taught by the Church of England, being compared, it will be found, that the Church of England is the safest to joyne with in Gods service vnto salvation.</p>
